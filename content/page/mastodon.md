Since late 2017 I've mostly moved from Twitter to [Mastodon][md] where I have
multiple accounts:

* [@zerok@chaos.social][cs]: Chaos.social is where lots of people from the
  German hacker and security scene are. Originally, I wanted to use my
  account here to keep better in touch with the CCC community but it
  eventually became my primary account where I write in both, English
  and German.
* [@zerok@mastodon.social][ms]: This was primary account for quite
  some time but is now mostly abandonned.
* [@zerok@wandering.shop][ws]: Wandering.shop has tons of authors and sci-fi
  fans so this is where I mostly write about the books that I'm reading and if
  there is something sci-fi-related.
