Since late 2017 I've mostly moved from Twitter to [Mastodon][md] where I have
multiple accounts:

* [@zerok@mastodon.social][ms]: This is my primary account where I write about
  pretty much everything I care about.
* [@zerok@wandering.shop][ws]: Wandering.shop has tons of authors and sci-fi
  fans so this is where I mostly write about the books that I'm reading and if
  there is something sci-fi-related.
* [@zerok@chaos.social][cs]: Chaos.social is where lots of people from the
  German hacker and security scene are. I'm mostly here for hacker-space and
  related topics.
