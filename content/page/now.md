- Still using Bullet Journaling to organize my day-to-day life. You can find my
  latest retrospective
  [here](/weblog/2020/09/13/six-months-of-bullet-journaling/).
- Very much into fountain pens and Leuchtturm 1917 products.
- Trying out GraphQL and reading the GraphQL Guide.


## Hobby software projects

I always tinker with some software in my spare-time but these are the ones that
are receiving the most amount of attention right now:

- [webmentiond][] for sending and receiving webmentions
