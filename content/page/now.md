- Back at Netconomy after 6 months of educational leave with some
  certifications and university courses.
- Still using Bullet Journaling to organize my day-to-day life. You can find my
  latest retrospective
  [here](/weblog/2020/09/13/six-months-of-bullet-journaling/).
- Looking forward to getting a new iPad or iPad Air with Pencil support.
- Very much into fountain pens and Leuchtturm 1917 products.
