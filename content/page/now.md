- I'm currently on educational leave to learn what new broad knowledge is
  taught in academia as part of computer science curricula since I got my
  degree (i.e.  ethics and innovation management).

- At the same time I'm working on acquiring various technology certifications
  (e.g. the one as [Kubernetes Application Developer][ckad] which I got in
  April 2020).

- Participating in the [#100DaysToOffload][100d] challenge

## Hobby software projects

I always tinker with some software in my spare-time but these are the ones that
are receiving the most amount of attention right now:

- [astats][] for extracing just the bare minimum analytics out of Caddy 2 JSON
  access logs.
- [geotrace][] for persisting data generated by [Overland][]
- [webmentiond][] for sending and receiving webmentions
