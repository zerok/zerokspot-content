Having attended GopherCon US back in 2018 in Denver and since the European
edition of that event had been rescheduled to a week I simply didn't have time,
I took the opportunity to attend GopherCon US 2020! It had been set up as an
online event with sessions starting around 16:00 and going all the way until
midnight Central European Time.

Watching these talks after a normal workday turned out to be challenging but
doable and I absolutey loved that event! Brian and Eric again did all the
moderation and there was just so much love and humor put into everything, it
was simply amazing!

That's how you do an online-conference, with chat not in some weird
conference-platform but simply re-using existing solutions like Discord and
Slack!
