Every time someone at the office mentions "Captain Obvious", it opens a huge time sink-hole for me thanks to this guy:

If you live in Canada or the USA you've probably seen him and the marketing campaign by [hotels.com][h] built around him on TV. They've been broadcasted since 2014 and even the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/business/media/for-hotelscoms-campaign-the-answer-was-obvious.html) wrote about them back then. I stumbled upon these ads a couple of years ago while being in Montreal, Chicago, or Toronto around the time PyCon US was taking place in Montreal. And I immediate fell in love with the character.

Captain Obvious through all his spots will show you various features of the hotels.com booking platform and add self-evident statements around them. The first spot I saw was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhcH0c469F8) called "Eye Contact".

Here the Captain thinks a girl at a bar is flirting with him. He picks up his phone and starts booking a hotel room. When the scene concludes it becomes obvious that she was actually flirting with the person next to him. The spot ends by the Captain saying:

> Hotels.com: I don't need it right now.

In general, I haven't yet see a "Captain Obvious"-spot that *isn't* entertaining, something that not even Apple's ads have managed.
