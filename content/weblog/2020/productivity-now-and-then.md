Two days ago I overheard a discussion at another restaurant table  about personal productivity early in oneâ€™s career and later on. One of the participants said something like that they simply weren't as productive as before. From time to time I get pretty much the same feeling but thinking about it for a bit longer, I actually donâ€™t think Iâ€™m less productive than before. Especially when I work on things like webmentiond I can produce lots of output at a good quality level in basically no time at all. 

What changed over the last decade, though, is that my work no longer consists exclusively of producing code. Oftentimes decisions on a high level have to made. My brain, for some reason, simply doesnâ€™t count this as productive time even-though it most certainly is! Making decisions is extremely taxing to my brain and especially in the evening Iâ€™m more often than not too tired to even decide on things like what to eat the next day.

But also when it comes to code, the systems I now work on are far more complex than earlier in my career. Heck, 6 months ago I basically created an experimental backup systems for data stored in Kubernetes clusters with support for multiple data stores and retention plans in two weeks or so. Thatâ€™s definitely up from implementing a wishlist in an online shop. What I need now, though, is more structure.  I doubt that nowadays I could get anything done without some kind of task organisation system like GTD or bullet journaling. Earlier, my brain could simply work better within a chaos. 

Or did my own definition of chaos just change and in what areas I deem it acceptable? ðŸ™„
