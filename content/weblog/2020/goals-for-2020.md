Another year, another list of goals. But first, I want to take a little look back at the goals for 2019:

- ‚ùå Building a MVP for a family tree application: While I spent quite some time during the summer months working on that, the system is still far from being usable by others in my family.
- ‚úÖ Eating less meat: Over the course of the last 12 months I've dialed down consumption of meat quite drastically. I'm far from calling myself a vegetarian but I try to avoid esp. low-quality and non-regional sources of meat. This means that I'm now eating more vegetables and cheese than in previous years. So far, so good :)
- ‚úÖ 85kg by 1 July: I managed to get there in time. Sadly, I gained pretty much everything back by December so there is still work to do :)
- ‚úÖ At the gym once a week: With the exception of weeks where I was ill or simply couldn't make it due to traveling I managed to visit the gym (or do some other form of training when no gym was available) every single week of 2019!

For the new year I want to build upon what I did last year:

- By 1 July I want to be, once again, at 85kg. I did it once, I will do it again! To do this I will go to the gym **at least** once a week!
- I should really spend some time on the MVP for the family tree application.
- On the technical side I want to spend time getting better at pair-programming, TDD, and [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) in general. I've done all of that before but I really want to get back into the habit. Robert C. Martin's book ["Clean Agile"](http://www.informit.com/store/clean-agile-back-to-basics-9780135781869) motivated me quite a bit on that front!

iOS development is something else I've tried again and again over the last couple of years. So perhaps I will succeed this time around, I don't really want to put that into a goal, though. Also: Three is a good number to focus on üòÖ
