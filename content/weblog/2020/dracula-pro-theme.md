For the longest time Iâ€™ve been jumping around between various dark-background themes for my text editors. From time to time I prefer monokai, then Dracula again, then something else entirely. A couple of days ago I listened to a recent episode of [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/405) in which Adam and Jerod interviewed [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/), the author of [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/), about Dracula Pro.

[Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro) is basically a streamlined version of Dracula which comes with a handful of variants and additional material like a clear design guide for the scheme and some really nice wallpapers. At $49 itâ€™s not the cheapest but itâ€™s IMO a great way to give back to the author whoâ€™s work (and derivates) are available for pretty much every text-editor under the sun ðŸ˜Š
