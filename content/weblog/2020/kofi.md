And today to something completely different: With more and more people using services like Patreon and Ko-Fi to earn a bit of extra money I also wanted to see how that works. For this reason and just in case anybody wants to buy me a hot beverage I've set up a [ko-fi.com account](https://ko-fi.com/zerok) last week 🙂 But this is just an experiment!

Why [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/)? Mostly because it's extremely simple and the name itself already somehow implies that it's just there to show gratitude instead of someone having to make a living with those donations.  At this point, all money that's coming in through this channel will be used for server bills and ... buying milk for the whole apartment (used for coffee, [hot chocolate](https://www.cameo.it/it-it/i-nostri-prodotti/ciobar/ciobar/ciobar-gusto-classico), and morning cereals) 🥳So no, I don't depend on any money coming in but I'd definitely put it to good use 😁
