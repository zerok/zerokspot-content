After a couple of quite stressful weeks we wanted to see something action-rich, funny, and simply entertaining this weekend. Before realising that we also considered watching Bombshell but then decided against it in favour of watching it at home once it becomes available on Blu-ray or Amazon Video.

Anyway: Action, fun, entertainment. [Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_Prey_(2020_film)) meets all these criteria. I didn't expect more than that but I was actually positively surprised. The movie does not rely on any of the better known heroes and villains in the universe but lets the female protagonists find their own place in this world. Everything is told from the perspective of Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) after her break-up with the Joker (or "Mister J" as she likes to call him). Immediately, quite a few people want to use that split between the two as an opportunity for some payback against her and she soon finds herself in more than just one dangerous situation involving Roman Sionis (played by Ewan McGregor) but soon receives some help from Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).

Why people have a wish to eliminate the former Joker-fangirl is explained through lots of humorous flashbacks. In general, I really enjoyed the way Harley told her story. It's funny and witty. Coming to think about it, the only aspect I didn't like was that some of the characters were not developed enough. Especially the big bad guy Roman Sionis had only one or two scenes showing his evilness.

But that did only very little to subtract from the entrainment factor of the movie. The highlight are definitely the fight scenes throughout the movie. This was also the first "super hero movie" in which the protagonists actively communicated and collaborated throughout the fight.

Fitting with Harley Quinn some scenes are extremely brutal but if you don't mind this, I can definitely recommend "Birds of Prey"! ðŸ˜€
