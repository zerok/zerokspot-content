After [writing about comments yesterday](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/04/comments-using-webmentions/
) I've now implemented experimental support for comment-type mentions in [webmentiond][w]. Using Will Norris's [microformats parser for Go](https://github.com/willnorris/microformats), the current implementation will look for an h-entry at the source-URL of the mention and use its p-name for the `title`, e-content for the `content` of the mention, and u-author for its author. All these properties will be stored inside the `webmentions` table of the database. If the entry has a `u-is-reply-to` link, then the whole mention will receive the `type` `comment`.

At this point, the content is truncated after 500 characters (or actually after 497 in order to always have a maximum of 500 characters) before being stored inside the database.

These new fields are also exposed in the relevant HTTP-API endpoints for each mention. You can see an example for this by looking at the response body of [this request](https://zerokspot.com/webmentions/get?target=https%3A%2F%2Fzerokspot.com%2Fweblog%2F2020%2F04%2F09%2Fsome-people%2F):

    "content":"Some people donâ€™t wear their mask over mouth and nose.Thatâ€™s something I donâ€™t understand at all. If some people wear masks, why donâ€™t they wear them right? I see that sometimes when I go for a walk alone. People pass by me who have a mask over their mouth, but their nose is not covered.In order to generally avoid the narrowness in the supermarket more, I now only go shopping once a week at most and drive to a supermarket that is much bigger and where one can keep more distance than in the supermarket around the corner. Another advantage: The offer is also much better and there are still more of the things I want to buy. (But they didnâ€™t have toilet paper either.)",

]
```

To use this new implementation, simply pull [zerok/webmentiond](https://hub.docker.com/r/zerok/webmentiond):latest and restart your server ðŸ™‚

I've also updated the rendering of mentions on my blog, which makes the mention listed above to appear like this:
