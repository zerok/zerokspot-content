[Deep Space Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine), especially later seasons were probably the most memorable moments of Star Trek for me. That whole Dominion storyline was just amazing and gave characters like Garak finally a time to shine!

Now, 20 years after the last episode had aired, I had forgotten most of those little highlights until I heard [this episode of the Alienating the Audience podcast with Andrew Heaton and Tom Merritt](https://twitter.com/MightyHeaton/status/1253395003851882496)

For instance, I had completely forgotten about the Marquis and also about that Gul Dukat had eventually become a vessel for Pagh Wraiths. Damn, and now I want to watch the show again ðŸ˜…
