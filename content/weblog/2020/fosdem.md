Better late than never, but I definitely wanted to write a little bit about my trip to [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) this year! It all started off with a little downer due to some flight delays / reschedules but all of us eventually arrived at around 15:00 at Motel One Rue Royale, ready to grab some dinner and then some drinks at the [official beer event](https://fosdem.org/2020/beerevent/).

More tired than expected we missed the first couple of slots the next day (Saturday) but at least had a delicious breakfast at [Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_(bakery))! I'm pretty sure, if we had one of these in Graz, it would be the end of me.

OK, but how was FOSDEM itself? It was fantastic! In fact, I enjoyed this year's event probably more than the last two combined! Unlike previous years I experimented a little bit with the tracks but also *didn't try too hard* to get into specific talks.  Instead, I jumped mostly between tracks and also took some time off when I felt like it in order to get some coding done.

There was one big change in the available rooms this year that helped with that: A second large cafeteria called Chez ThÃ©o was now available alongside the rather small one in building F. Not all that many power outlets but still... That new space came at one cost: The bar below Janson was gone now. At first I was really sad about that simply because this was my first real memory of FOSDEM: A bar below the main session hall with snacks and beer. On the other hand, let's be honest: That room down there had two primary attributes: Overcrowded and freezy. I'm pretty sure I caught at least one cold over the years down there. The new cafeteria is heated and large enough to make it really hard to overcrowd it.

As for the talks, I managed to get into the following sessions:

- [Civil society needs Free Software Hackers](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/free_software_hackers_needed/) (Lightning talk)
- [A tool for Community Supported Agriculture](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/openolitor_community_supported_agriculture/) (Lightning talk)
- [What's in my food?](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/open_food_facts/) (Lightning talk)
- [HTTP/3 for everyone](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/http3/) (Keynote)
- [Continuous Delivery starts with Continuous Infrastructure](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/continuous_delivery_starts_with_continuous_infrastructure/) (CI/CD)
- [An event based approach for CI/CD pipelines](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/an_event_based_approach_for_cicd_pipelines/) (CI/CD)
- [Mario's adventures in Tekton land](Marioâ€™s adventures in Tekton land
https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/marios_adventures_in_tekton_land/
10:30 - 11:10) (CI/CD)
- [GNUnet](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_gnunet/) (Decentralized Internet)
- [The Path to Peer-to-Peer Matrix](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/) (Decentralized Internet)
- [FOSSH - 2000 to 2020 and beyond!](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/fossh/) (Keynote)
- [FOSDEM@20 - A Celebration](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/fosdem_at_20/) (Keynote)

Still lots of talks to watch as recordings. For instance (as you can see from the list above) I didn't go to the Go, Rust, or Monitoring-tracks at all this year and only saw a handful of talks in the CI/CD devroom. So I'll probably spend 10 hours more on watching all those talks that I've missed ðŸ˜‚

I just hope I'll be able to catch up by January next year when FOSDEM 2021 comes! 

Oh, before I forget: Yes, it rained again but this time at least not every day ðŸ¥³
