Way to collaborate on personal websites and make the whole medium more accessible (again) to new people.

> Homebrew Website Club is a growing world-wide network of meetups for everyone who wants to take back their web experience from social media silos, and own their online identities & content, or just want support with blogging!

1. Broadcast: Introduce what you want to do about your personal website or that you would like to ask others about.
2. Group up depending on the projects and topics that were introduced during the broadcast phase


What's the difference to something like "Webmontag"?
