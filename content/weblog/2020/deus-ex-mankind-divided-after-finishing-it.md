A couple of days ago I wrote a little [review of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/07/22/deus-ex-mankind-divided/) on the PS4. At that time I hadnâ€™t yet finished the game but was already about two thirds to three quarters through the main storyline.

This afternoon I finally finished the last story mission. My overall opinion of the game hasnâ€™t changed but the last three stages are worth mentioning as they are the most atmospherical. Sadly, especially the second to last stage (Prague in lockdown mode) demonstrated once again how much the PS4 is stuggling with keeping the frame-rate up. That being said, the missions in all three areas were IMO the best of the whole game!

Lots of sneaking but also a lot of opportunity to play around with the higher-level augmentations. Within these last couple of hours Iâ€™ve also finally learnt how to increase the available inventory space ðŸ˜… This way I at least had enough ammo for the final battle (hint: air ducts are your friends).
