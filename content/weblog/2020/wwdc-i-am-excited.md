I have to say, Mondayâ€™s [keynote to this yearâ€™s WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/101/) was probably the best Apple keynote Iâ€™ve seen in years. There was simply far too much for me to get excited about in there ðŸ¥³

- Dictation in iOS will be handled on-device only! No more calls to the central servers so I feel finally safe to also use it ðŸ™‚ Same goes for translation support by the neural engine!
- It will be possible to hide pages on the iOS home screen! Hopefully this will finally be the end of the mess I call my phoneâ€™s home screen ðŸ¤ª
- Scribble support in every input field on iPadOS. This was basically the feature Iâ€™ve been waiting for to finally get a newer iPad with Pencil :D
- AirPods can now automatically switch between devices depending on where you have something with an audio channel 
- Sleep tracking on watchOS
- Isaac Asimovâ€™s Foundation as AppleTV+ exclusive! If I remember correctly, this series was the first sci-fi I read as a kid. I was sitting on some beach either in Greece or Italy, bored, and basically killed that book rented from a library in a day or two. I think, after nearly 30 years it might be time to re-read it ðŸ˜…
- Heck, Iâ€™m even excited about their transition to ARM-based CPUs for their Mac hardware. I cannot remember how it was back when they moved from PowerPC to Intel but having a $500 hardware dev-kit available sounds definitely like a good way make the transition easier for developers!

And these are just the things that come to mind right now. Iâ€™m pretty sure that over the course of the week Iâ€™m going to find more things to look forward to and to play around with. From a developerâ€™s point of view Iâ€™m especially looking forward to mess around with the improved Swift UI handling in Xcode 12. Coming from React+Redux I like the whole concept but the IDE support in Xcode 11 was simply not good enough for me to actually also enjoy it. ðŸ¤ž
