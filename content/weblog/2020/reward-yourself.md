After getting the confirmation that I had [passed the Kubernetes Application Developer certification exam](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/15/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/) I ran into a bit of a motivation black hole. I usually try to make myself a little gift every time I finish an exam or after completing some other milestones but being at home for 2 months has basically robbed me off any kind of imagination in this regard. While I saw some bags on Timbuk2.com that I’d like to have, I didn’t see the need as going out was limited anyway. Last Friday, finally, I found something: I rode my bike to my [favourite brewery](https://www.sudhaus.at/) and got myself a couple of bottles of my favourite beer. Right before that I had stumbled upon [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) which turned out to be another really awesome gift to myself!

In order to keep my motivation up I’m now explicitly looking for little treats to [reward myself at least every couple of days](https://austinkleon.com/2020/05/11/give-yourself-a-little-present/) even if I don’t achieve any milestone. Sitting at home all day, not being able to attend any conferences or meeting up with friends simply requires some counter-weight!

What’s your process here and/or what were some of your favourite gifts to yourself in the past?
