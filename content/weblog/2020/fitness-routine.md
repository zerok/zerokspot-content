OK, that title is probably a bit of an exaggeration. I try to go to the gym (for at least around 30 minutes) once a week and at most every two days. Unless Iâ€™m at a conference somewhere and have access to a hotel gym I practically never reach this bi-daily interval. One thing that has stuck with me from those conference trips and that I now try to revive due to being mostly at home is the time for those training sessions.

Back in 2018 when I a friend and I were in Denver for [GopherCon](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/09/17/gophercon-recap/), I got up at around 6am and went straight to the gym before picking up some breakfast. While my energy level for the rest of the day might be slightly diminished, I *felt* much better and less stressed. After returning home and even-though I have a gym in the same building as my apartment I completely forgot about that. Thanks to home-office/home-schooling/home-university/educational leave Iâ€™m once again at the liberty of not having to rush into the morning-work-routine and can just walk down to the gym and go onto the cross trainer or bike before having to do anything else.

A good start for the day ðŸ™‚ (And afterwards the breakfast is even more delicious ðŸ˜…).
