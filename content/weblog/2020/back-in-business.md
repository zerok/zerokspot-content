Today at around 14:00 oâ€™clock it finally happened: I got my laptop back which had been at an Apple service partner since [July 14](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/07/14/butterflies-should-be-beautiful/). This also means that I can finally continue working properly on things like webmentiond and other side-projects.

Since this whole episode took a bit longer I thought I should aggregate the major dates in a little timeline:

- July 14: Contact store via email to get an estimate. They told me it would around one week and that Iâ€™d leave the device with them for the whole time between assessment and repair.
- July 14: Handed the MBP over and got the following estimate: 7-10 days.
- July 24: Send the shop an email and learnt that it should still take until the middle of next week (July 27 - August 2)
- July 31: Called in the morning and heard that it should be ready on that day.
- August 1: Called the store and got the information that they were *still* waiting for a part and it will probably take until the middle of next week. (August 3 - August 9)
- August 3: Laptop is ready for pickup.

I also talked with someone at the store at length about what had gone wrong and why it had taken so long. I wonâ€™t go into details here but he convinced me that it wasnâ€™t their fault. Things have gone wrong that were not under their control regarding the replacement parts. That being said, I think that my [complains regarding transparency and repair statuses](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/08/01/repair-status-visibility/) are still valid ðŸ™‚

This whole thing has told me once again, though, that I should properly invest in a contingency plan. I thought that my Windows PC should be enough to keep me productive but I somehow went into the rabbit hole of trying to use Docker via [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) inside of VisualStudio Code. Letâ€™s say it this way: The performance of that stack hasnâ€™t convince me. Next time: skip Docker and just go with WSL2 all the way or get a backup Mac in order to stay sane.

Iâ€™ve also now finally [a SSH setup on iOS](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/07/27/finding-a-good-ssh-client-for-ios/) that Iâ€™m comfortable with. Now I just have to find the time to also set up part 2 of my contingency plan: A Raspberry PI that I can use  and connect with from my iPad even without a laptop nearby. This is something that has been on my list for literally years now but I think I should finally get started ðŸ™„
