For the last two weeks I’ve now been writing all my blogposts exclusively with [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) while handling notes (i.e. comments, likes, links) using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). Ulysses has finally allowed me to write posts including images without having to do any additional steps before publishing them. Sure, part of that is thanks to some [custom coding around converting TextPack files](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/20/writing-blog-posts-using-ulysses/) into proper pull-requests for my site, but I wouldn’t have spent all this time and effort if the writing experience wasn’t great!

A big part of that is the **seamless hand-off between iOS and macOS** apps. It’s not as instantaneous as with Drafts but it’s still fast enough and usually doesn’t get in my way. 

I also really like the way the **sidebar** is implemented and gives you a quick overview of what’s in a folder/group/project including nested groups. For instance, I have one project called “My Blog” which contains all the drafts I’m working on at a time. Once a draft has reached the point where I can publish it but still want to wait for the next day (for various reasons) I just move it into a subfolder called “Ready”. Content of such subfolders is still listed in the navigation but grouped.

Something that I only found out about a couple of days ago is the CMD+o shortcut, which allows you **quick navigation** between the most recently worked on documents. That shortcut is not only available on macOS but also on iOS if you have a keyboard connected!

So, while Ulysses is not cheap at €40 per year, I consider it well worth it! I think nothing has ever streamlined my writing process that much before! Writing is fun again!
