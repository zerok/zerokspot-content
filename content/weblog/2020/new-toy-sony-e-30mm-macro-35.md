I wanted something which could be used for macro photography and especially a lens with a really short minimum focus distance. The Sony [SEL30M35](https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel30m35) fits that bill quite nicely being able to focus at a distance of only 9.5cm!

As you can see from the picture above, Iâ€™m still struggling a little bit with the aperture on such a short distance but thatâ€™s hopefully only a matter of time ðŸ˜…
