For the last couple of yearâ€™s Iâ€™ve had a weird relationship with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Iâ€™ve always wanted to learn it; not because Go or Python have been bad for me or Iâ€™ve hit some insurmountable walls there but simply because Iâ€™m curious about the language, its eco-system, and in what ways it might influence my problem-solving approaches. It certainly also helps that the community from the outside gives me the same vibes as the Python community ðŸ˜…

The one thing that always kills me, though, is on the technical side: Whenever I have to deal with [lifetimes annotations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html) I somehow loose it. I simply havenâ€™t reached the point where that and the rest of the language clicks with me. But that doesnâ€™t keep me from trying! Last time I entered around [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/) by [Jim Blandy](https://www.red-bean.com/jimb/) and [Jason Orendorff](https://github.com/jorendorff). This time I want to use the [Rust track on Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/rust) in combination with VSCode. This way I will hopefully not waste too much time on configuring my editor and tooling around the language and be able to focus on coding.

So far, the Rust track had a nice learning curve and I didnâ€™t have to deal with lifetimes too much ðŸ˜… Sadly, the mentors might be slightly understaffed but perhaps Iâ€™ll be able to help out once Iâ€™ve grown more comfortable with the language. I just hope Iâ€™ll make it this far this time around!

In the meantime, Iâ€™ve switched from mentor to practice mode. While getting high-quality code review is awesome, at first I want to stay motivated and therefore want to make my way as fast as possible from problem to problem. Soâ€¦ on to the next exercise ðŸ˜€
