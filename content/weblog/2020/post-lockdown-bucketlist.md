One of the first things I did when it became apparent that this lockdown would take a little longer, was to create a list of things I wanted to do pretty much right after being able to live outside my apartment again. Non of the items should be hard to complete but should simply be things that I liked to do before plus a little extra mindfulness sprinkled over it. 

So that's what's currently on it:

- Have a beer at [Sudhaus](https://www.sudhaus.at/) (brewery in Graz)
- Eat a Pizza at [SÃ¤gewerk](http://www.diebausatzlokale.at/saegewerk-klassik-desktop/)
- Take a train to Vienna and enjoy [7Stern-BrÃ¤u](http://www.7stern.at/de-de/)
- BBQ w/ friends
- Go to a nice spa
- Visit a nice book store (that will probably take a bit longer as I'd really visit Powell's againâ€¦)

If you have any recommendations that are reachable by train from Graz, please let me know ðŸ™‚
