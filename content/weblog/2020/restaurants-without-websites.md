Just recently I once again came across two restaurants that I wanted to go to but simply couldnâ€™t find any information about outside of their Facebook pages. I know that having an up-to-date website is not part of their core competency, but at least I for one absolutely love to look up a restaurantâ€™s menu before I go there.

In fact, I think a restaurantâ€™s website only has to answer a very short list of questions:

1. Where are they and can I use a delivery service with them?
2. Do I need to make a reservation and if so then how?
3. When are they open and might there be a special event on a given date for which the location is only available to a closed group?
4. Whatâ€™s their menu (including prices please!)
5. How can I pay? Do I need to go to an ATM before coming or are cards fine?

On the technical side there is one last *must-have*: The site has to look somehow usable on a phoneâ€¦ I really donâ€™t want to have to pinch and zoom my way around 20 submenus just to find out whatâ€™s on the menu.

Outside of these 5+1 points that I consider mandatory, there are additional things that might be good to know like how the place looks like. Usually, things like Google reviews, Foursquare etc. already do quite a good job there, so IMO a restaurantâ€™s website does not need to have a photo gallery containing hundreds of pictures from every single holiday party theyâ€™ve had so far. So pictures would still be nice, though, in order to get a feeling for the place.

At this point Iâ€™m not sure why a restaurant wouldnâ€™t have at least a domain for a very minimal website and e-mail. Perhaps they donâ€™t know that some folks really prefer that over Facebook or itâ€™s just too much distraction from actually managing the location. I somehow want to help especially smaller places with that but, honestly, this should be [a job for the WKO](https://www.wko.at/service/innovation-technologie-digitalisierung/online-marketing.html).

A couple of years ago I also heard of some folks who just created restaurant websites for places they really liked and then simply gifted them to the owners. While thatâ€™s a nice gesture, it wonâ€™t help in the long run as someone has to maintain that page. Even if your website only answers the 5 questions Iâ€™ve listed above, at least the opening hours and menu will change over time. A website that contains outdated information isnâ€™t helping anyone. People have to be able to make such changes themselves without having to pay someone again and again.

Perhaps something like that would be a fun pro-bono side project where a couple of developers/designers could collaborate under strict rules as to what kind of businesses theyâ€™d provide such a service to. I donâ€™t have any concrete plans on that front but I think it would be fun *and* immensely useful for people who want to get started with their restaurant ðŸ™‚ This might also be a nice use-case for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) + [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) (or something similar) ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜…
