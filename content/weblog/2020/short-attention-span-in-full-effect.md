title: Short attention span in full effect

During the last couple of days and weeks I’ve grown more and more restless. For instance, I can no longer read an article (even a short one) to the end before doing something else. It feels like my attention span has now shortened to something like 2 minutes which starts to really annoy me. I *want* to read [Chuck Wendig’s “Wanderers”](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/project/wanderers/) (which is awesome, btw.), I *want* to listen to that podcast, I *want* to read the latest article from my blogroll.

So I will try something different today: Whenever I finish a piece of work, I set out to follow that with *exactly one* podcast or *exactly one* chapter in the book. Perhaps I can calm my nerves this way.

Additionally, I’m currently in the process of pretty much unfollowing everyone on Twitter for whom I can find a RSS/Atom feed. This way, Twitter will cease to be a news-source for me and only be a place to talk with people. The same goes for visiting sites for news: If your site offers a feed, I will use that, so that I no longer have to jump around the web all the time just to stay up to date. If your site doesn’t have an RSS feed (or anything else that’s supported by [FeedBin](https://feedbin.com/)) I probably won’t show up  in your access logs all that often anymore. This should help me focusing again. Fingers crossed.
