For the longest time Iâ€™ve been lucky: My 2018 MacBook Pro didnâ€™t show any symptoms that were plaguing tons of other folks (and that [Apple acknowledged](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks) after a lot of complaining) [where some keys stopped working from time to time or acting as if being hit multiple times](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/). Sadly, about a month ago my luck ended. Due to university courses and other obligations I couldnâ€™t bring my laptop in for repair, though, and so I worked as much as possible using external keyboards.

Today was now the first day where I could send my trusted workhorse of for some well-deserved repairs. The estimate at this point is that Iâ€™ll be without a proper work device at least for the rest of the week. Luckily, I am prepared ðŸ˜… I might just install some coding tools on a VM somewhere and code from my iPad via SSH ðŸ˜‚
