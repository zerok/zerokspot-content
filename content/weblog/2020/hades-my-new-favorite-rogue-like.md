I havenâ€™t yet played too many rogue-likes before but I always enjoyed them for the very high replayability they offer. Dead Cells has been amazing and I still come back to it every now and then. But [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/), the latest game by Supergiant Games, is even better than that! As Zagreus, son of Hades, you try to escape from the underworld and join the Olympians.

In pure dungeon-crawler style you use one of six weapons in order to fight through the Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium. Each stage consists of multiple chambers filled with the beasts of the underworld. After clearing a chamber, you get either currency that persists through each death, currency that doesnâ€™t, or some upgrade to your weapon. What makes Hades so enjoyable to me is that even if you manage to only finish a handful of chambers you always get something that survives even if you donâ€™t.

At first I was a little bit afraid that the Switch might not be able to handle some of the more intense fights but I havenâ€™t yet noticed any real slow-downs! And all that while the game looks beautiful! Sure, itâ€™s not as high-res as on the PC, but itâ€™s still amazing what Supergiant Games managed to get out of the little box.

Similar to Transistor and Bastion, Hades also once again has an amazing soundtracks. Itâ€™s a good thing that it is also available for purchase or Spotify!

I havenâ€™t yet managed a single escape but Iâ€™m getting closer and closer. With some improvement always around the next corner itâ€™s also quite hard to put the game down, so Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ll manage my first escape soon! ... and continue playing until Iâ€™ve collected at least the majority of the in-game achievements ðŸ˜…
