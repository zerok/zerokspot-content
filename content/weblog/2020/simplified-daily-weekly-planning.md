About a month ago, [u/tinyconversation0](https://reddit.com/u/tinyconversation0) posted in [r/bujo](https://reddit.com/r/bujo) a [nice, compact way of combining daily and weekly pages](https://www.reddit.com/r/bujo/comments/g3z8vx/it_took_a_while_to_figure_out_a_weekly_spread/) in a bullet-journal-like way. Recently, more often than not I wasnâ€™t able to fill even half a page of my journal each day and so I thought, I should give that structure a try!

Iâ€™ve now completed a week with it and it has exceeded my expectations. Being able to see my weekly goals every day of the week has improved my planning immensely. Itâ€™s extremely calming to know what has to be done by the end of the day **and** by the end of the week.

The only thing that I changed about u/tinyconversation0â€™s template is that Iâ€™ve given Saturday and Sunday complete columns instead of only half a column per day. Weekends are not that different from weekends when it comes to the amount of tasks to be completed. The tasks themselves are, but not their quantity.

Will I stick with this format for the foreseeable future? No, I'm still experimenting and next I want to get rid of fixed daily columns/pages altogether and do classic rapid logging with a single spread to organize my weekly schedule. Perhaps next week, perhaps later, â€¦ ðŸ™‚
