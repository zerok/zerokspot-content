For more than [50 nights](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/portland-protests-federal-agents.html?referringSource=articleShare) there have now been protests in the US and other countries after the death of George Floyd. One place where these have more and more escalated into a testbed on how far the federal government wants to fight them has a special place in my heart: Portland, Oregon. Not a day goes by when I don’t see news of protestors being attacked and beaten mostly from federal  agents without any visible identifications.

Just last evening a video made the rounds where [one man](https://twitter.com/thechadallan/status/1284749219857760256) was beaten and pepper-sprayed by multiple agents in battle armor. Despite all that he stood his ground. [Later on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/20/christopher-david-portland-protest-video/), it turned out that his right hand had been badly damaged in that attack. Today, [a reporter wrote](https://twitter.com/DonovanFarley/status/1285107209085480960) that he had been shot at probably using rubber bullets that left more than just a mark on his torso.

Sending armed troops that seem not even be remotely interested in deescalation doesn’t compute with me. I don’t get it and I don’t want to get it. To all the citizens of Portland I can just send my best wishes. Stay safe!
