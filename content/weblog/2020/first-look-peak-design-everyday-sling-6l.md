Oh my, another bag? Yes, sorry! I was looking for a more lightweight sling back compared to my various messengers and backpacks which would force me to only pack the most necessary items I need every day and don‚Äôt tempt me to just fill it up to capacity. I wanted to only carry the following items with me:

- My Sony NEX 6 with a single lens that‚Äôs attached to it
- My journal, fountain pen, pencil, pen 
- A battery pack
- My iPad and the necessary adapter and cable to connect the camera to it
- ID + my wallet
- A rain coat

Actually, the camera is optional but it would be nice if I could still fit it in there since I want to be able to take more high quality pictures again even when I‚Äôm on the go. That being said, the primary reason why I wanted another small bag was to have one that only contains the absolute necessary items that I need everywhere I go and that doesn‚Äôt take up too much space in restaurants and coffee shops üòâ

So I went looking and stumbled upon the [Peak Design Everyday Sling 6l](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-sling) which pretty much fits the bill *and* also offers me lots of attachment options thanks to external straps. It also was in my budget for that project (or only very minimally over it) with ‚Ç¨109 at a local photo store so off I went to get it.

## Internal setup/organisation

Internally, the bag has one large main compartment accessible through a double-zipper. The main compartment can be split using the two adjustable (and removable) dividers. These allow you to make a space where your camera fits perfectly. Sadly, the NEX 6 is wide enough that my journal does not fit alongside the camera into the main compartment.

On the back-wall of the main compartment is a padded section where a 10.x‚Äù tablet fits in. There is a tiny magnet at the top of the separator for that sleeve that helps keep it closed if not used. I‚Äôve for now put my iPad, a small external keyboard, and my journal in there. These slightly decrease the available space in the main compartment but the zippers still close easily without me having to put any kind of pressure onto them.

At the top of the compartment is another small section where things like cloths and memory cards can be stored. Right now this is the place where I put my pens.

## Outside

All the insides are protected by a quite durable looking 400D nylon that‚Äôs supposed to be at least weatherproof. That being said, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to put that to the test in a heavy thunderstorm if I can avoid it.

At the front is a hidden zipper giving access to a small compartment which I'm using for my photo ID. For some reason I expected that one to be slightly larger but it's enough for my needs.

In the bottom of the bag are four small loops where additional straps can be hooked in for holding a vest or something like that. Another extension point is available on the left and right of the bag where you can fit for instance a [Peak Design Capture clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture), which I got last Friday (another ‚Ç¨70, more on that most likely some other time)

Last but not least I should probably also write a little bit about the strap. It‚Äôs well-padded but the main highlight is a quick-release buckle with which you can easily switch the length of the strap from carry-mode to easy-access-mode. Since the buckle also has a little ring where you can fit your index-finger through its far more comfortable to pull than what Timbuk 2 has at least on those bags that I own.


## Closing thoughts

I've only had the bag for a couple of days now but so far I really like it. As I wrote above, I'd have liked the main compartment and/or the tablet sleeve to be a little larger, but other than that, it's great üôÇ
