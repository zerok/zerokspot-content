Over the last couple of days I've given [ComiXology][c] a try after
hearing about it from various sources. If you don't know it yet, it's
basically an ebook-store for comics with (1) a huge catalog, (2) a
really well-made app, and (3) [DRM-free backups][d] of comics where
the publisher has allowed it (sadly, there aren't all that many
yet). My main motivation for signing up was to finally cross one item
from my to-read-list: [Saga][s] vol. 1 by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona
Staples.

Saga tells the story of Hazel, a girl who is born into a galaxy
dominated by the war between the people of the planet Landfall and
those of its moon Wreath. The first being a people of winged humanoids
with a focus on high technology while the latter being horned
magic-users. In the first installments of the series you get know
Hazel's parents: Marko, the father, coming from Wreath, who was a
war-prisoner locked away in a cell on the planet Cleave, and Alana
being the mother who comes from Landfall and was originally tasked to
guard Marko. Obviously, that went spectacularly wrong and now they are
on the run from both authorities right when Hazel is born.

So far I've only read the first volume (and am currently in the
process of finishing the second) and I was hooked right away. The
authors managed to create a world with both, high-tech and magic, that
is interesting, not over-the-top, and simply full of life. If I could
complain about one aspect it would be that most of the side-stories so
far have a highly-sexualized topic. That being said, that's also true
for most of Isaac Assimov's and John Scalzi's stories I've read so far
(basically everyone has sex pretty much all the time), so I'm not
complaining.

In fact, I liked the story so much that I bought the second volume
right after finishing the first! Part of that decision was also caused
by reading comics inside the ComiXology app was far more pleasant than
I had anticipated. Being able to focus on a single cell and then
swiping to navigate between them in the right order seemlessly pretty
much sold me. This way I can not only read on my iPad but also on my
phone without having to pinch and zoom all the time.

ComiXology has been a subsidiary of Amazon since 2015. This has the
added benefit that I can buy most comics also on Amazon.de as a bundle
for both Kindle and ComiXology for mostly the same price (at a â‚¬ ~0.50
delta). Would I buy also DRM'd content on ComiXology if it were
available at roughly the same price somewhere-else without DRM? Most
likely not. I won't distinguish between normal ebooks and comics
here. But for Saga everything worked out!

This little expiment also showed me that I could enjoy comics again. I
had loved reading mangas and things like Asterix and Lucky Luke when I
was a teenager but eventually gave up on them due to their high
price. I simply got more entertainment out of reading a 400 pages
sci-fi novel than a 100-pages comic at twice the price. Still, if
something makes it onto my to-read list I usually give it a try. The
abstract of Saga still sounded interesting to me and now I can
definitely see myself reading the whole series and potentially also
other comics in the future!
