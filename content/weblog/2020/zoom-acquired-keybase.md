Yesterday, [Zoom][z] and [Keybase][k] announced that the first had acquired the latter. Let's put it this way: I was not surprised that Keybase was acquired but I *was* surprised and, quite frankly, shocked that they are now part of Zoom.

Zoom currently has a [big trust issue](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/04/03/zoom-not-suited-for-secrets/) and they are just now with their 90-days-of-security plan starting to work on implementing some of the features everyone assumed they were already offering based on their marketing wording. Keybase wanted to be basically a web-of-trust implementation and Zoom is struggling with the basic concept of trust here. But before going there, let's take a look at both announcements:

> Initially, our single top priority is helping to make Zoom even more secure. There are no specific plans for the Keybase app yet.
> 
> -- [keybase.io][k]

OK, so they got acquired without specific plans for their current offering. Judging from that I'd say that Keybase is now in a maintenance mode at best until Zoom decides what they want to do with it.

> We are excited to integrate Keybaseâ€™s team into the Zoom family to help us build end-to-end encryption that can reach current Zoom scalability. 
> 
> -- [zoom][z]

This sounds even more like an [acq-hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring) to me. This is also the only non-generic statement mentioning Keybase in their whole announcement. Note that it only mentions Keybase's team (as do all the other statements in the Zoom announcement) and not Keybase, the product. 

I simply don't have a good feeling about this (unlike when they announced their blog chain plans) and therefore deleted my Keybase account. 

P.S.: [Gregory Hammond][g] also has a nice write-up about this on his blog.
