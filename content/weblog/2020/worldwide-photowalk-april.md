**UPDATE:** Flickr announced via a blog post that the worldwide photowalk (originally scheduled for April 4) [has been postponed](https://blog.flickr.net/2020/03/04/next-global-day-of-flickr-photowalks-on-april-4/) without any specific new date (yet).

I haven't been to a photowalk in a really long time. About 15 years ago I tried to be at pretty much every single one of these events in Klagenfurt and Vienna but with my move to Graz that somehow stopped. There seemed to be no active photowalks  Graz and I didn't have the strength to start one since I already had enough on my plate with PyGraz, having a new job, and living in a new city.

This April there is going to be a good chance for me to get back into the spirit: For April 4, 2020 [Flickr](https://flickr.com/) is organising - once again - [a worldwide photowalk](https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickr10photowalks/discuss/72157711370568813/). There is also a listing available for all the [local groups](https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickr10photowalks/discuss/72157711368357811/) that are going to participate.

In Austria there is currently [a group in Vienna](https://www.meetup.com/Shoot-Vienna/events/268948863/) that will focus on street photography along the banks of the Danube. That already sounds quites promising but perhaps other groups from other parts of the country will also be able to organise something ðŸ™‚

Anyway: I've already marked the day in my calendar!
