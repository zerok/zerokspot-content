After writing about [WriteTheDocs events going virtual](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/02/writethedocs-online/) in early May I completely missed that [WriteTheDocs Portland/Virtual now finally has a date](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/news/announcing-virtual-conf-dates-tickets/) and the organisers reopened their ticket-sale! The conference is now scheduled for 9 August - 11 August (with the writing day happening on 9 August).

[Tickets are available](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/tickets/) in 3 price categories:
- Unemployed/student: $25
- Independent: $100
- Corporate: $125
- … and a grant program in case you cannot afford any of these.

Sadly, during this whole time-range I’ve already something else scheduled but perhaps I’ll have more time with the September event. Anyway, if you have the time and are interested in documentation and technical writing in general, please attend! I will be well-worth your time!
