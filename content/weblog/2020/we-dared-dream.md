In this recent [guest post Una McCormack](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2020/02/14/the-big-idea-una-mccormack/) (author of many awesome Star Trek books) writes about some aspects of the new Star Trek show [Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard) and relates them to her own experience as a British national in the time of Brexit. 

Looking at it from this angle, Picard and TNG reflect quite well their respective zeitgeist where large scale cooperation and optimism seem to have been replaced with egoism, distrust, and hate.

> And that once upon a time, we dared to dream of futures which were not constructed upon exclusion and exploitation, but which reached outwards in the hope of collaboration, diversity, and mutual aid. Perhaps one day we will learn this trick again.

I really hope that I will see that day in my lifetime again ðŸ¥º
