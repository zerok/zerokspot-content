[Jamstack Conf](https://jamstackconf.com/) is an event series organized by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to bring to whole community that evolved over the course of the last couple of years around Jamstack together. Since 2018 there were conferences in London and San Francisco. With the current health crisis the London event for this year has been replaced with an [online-only event taking place on May 27 and 28](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/16/announcing-jamstack-conf-virtual-schedule-and-registration/). Looking at the schedule that's available right now there will be keynotes, lightning talks, round-table discussions, and even a coding challenge on the first day alone while the second day will offer some workshops.

Right now I cannot imagine how this will work out but I'm curious enough that I signed up and reserved these two days in my calendar ðŸ™‚ It also helps that the even is free ðŸ˜‰
