Thanks to Cory Doctorow’s [Pluralistic blog](https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/17/on-face-interaction/#survivingtomorrow) I stumbled upon the [Surviving Tomorrow anthology](https://www.survivingtomorrowanthology.com/) edited by Bryan Thomas Schmidt who previously also edited Andy Weir’s “The Martian”.

This anthology is a collection of 29 stories about people surviving extra-ordinary situations, contributed for authors like Cory Doctorow and Neil Gaiman. That being said, I don’t know most of the authors on the [contributors](https://www.survivingtomorrowanthology.com/contributors) page but, historically, anthologies have been great for getting to know folks I haven’t read anything from before!

> All profits from Surviving Tomorrow go to providing COVID-19 tests directly to the front lines of this crisis, or your portion can be earmarked for one of the charities you can select on the checkout page.

According to the description, also all authors have allowed their contributions to be published without remuneration.

The book is available in [multiple editions](https://www.survivingtomorrowanthology.com/shop) ranging in price from $5 for the eBook to $109 for the hard cover with metal clasp (!). The eBook is supposed to be released on 1 July, just in time for me to finish up with “Wanderers” 😅
