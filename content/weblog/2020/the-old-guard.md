[The Old Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Guard_(2020_film)) is a new movie available on Netflix starring [Charlize Theron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlize_Theron) as leader of an immortal squad of soldiers. Some of them had been around for many hundreds of years and fought in everything from small skirmishes all the way to world-wars. While their original mission was to just make the world better they soon face an adversary that wants to uncover their secrets. 

And if this wasnâ€™t enough, all of a sudden they become aware of someone who was just about to discover their immortality!

What follows are 125 minutes of pure actual with a bit of story in between gun fights. That being said, the backstory of all characters was intriguing enough for my taste ðŸ™‚

That and the banter between all members of squad simply made for a very entertaining movie that somehow felt like the pilot episode of a show. Now I just hope there will really be a show coming after this. I want to see more of them ðŸ˜…
