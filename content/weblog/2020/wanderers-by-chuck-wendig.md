Thanks to GoodRead’s [Best books of 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-science-fiction-books-2019) listing I stumbled upon Chuck Wendig’s latest book: [Wanderers](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/project/wanderers/). With nearly 800 pages it’s not a short book but the time spent here was well worth it. It took me more than a month to complete but that’s absolutely not the book’s fault!

The story is about a group of people that for no apparent reason leave everything and everyone behind and start marching like zombies. But they are not alone: The so-called “flock” soon gathers a following with their friends, family, and teams from the CDC and other parties trying to protect them on their way through the USA. What follows is a thrilling ride with everything from US agencies to white supremacists. There is even a powerful AI *and* an ageing rockstar!

If this sounds somehow like a soap opera to you, you wouldn’t be complete wrong: Wanderers - at least to me - felt like a good mix of soap, thriller, mystery, and sci-fi to me but only taking the good aspects from all with good character development, multiple parallel plot lines, high-tech *and* the CDC 😅 It triggered pretty much the same receptors in me as Walkaway did. back when I read it 😍

The only downside I can think of is that the eBook is not available in a non-DRM’d way.
