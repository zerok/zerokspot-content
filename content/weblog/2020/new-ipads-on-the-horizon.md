According to iMore Apple has just registered [7 new iPad models](https://www.imore.com/new-apple-watch-and-ipad-filings-suggest-release-imminent) at the Russian Eurasian Economic Commission. There is even hope that at least some of them will be new iPad Air 4 devices that might [do away with the home button](https://www.imore.com/leaked-ipad-air-4-manual-allegedly-shows-new-design-and-touch-id-power-button) in favour of moving Touch ID to the power button.

I’m currently in the market for a new iPad as my current one is a couple of years old and doesn’t yet support Apple Pencil (neither v1 nor v2). Given my recent obsession with handwriting and drawing I absolutely want one of these and have already planned to get one either in September or October (basically whenever a new model is released). If it also comes with a re-design then I’m even more looking forward to it 😁

Big PLEASE 😄
