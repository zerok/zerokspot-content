While evaluating [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) for writing future blog posts I stumbled upon the [TextBundle](http://textbundle.org/) file format which can be created by Ulysses and other editors like Bear. 

To quote the [specification](http://textbundle.org/spec/):

> The purpose of the TextBundle file format is to simplify the exchange of various plain text files together with additional images between sandboxed applications.

Letâ€™s take this post as an example and export it as TextBundle. The result is a single file by the name of `Working with TextBundles.textpack` which is a compressed TextBundle:

	unzip ./Working\ with\ TextBundles.textpack
	Archive:  ./Working with TextBundles.textpack
	   creating: Content.textbundle/
	   creating: Content.textbundle/assets/
	  inflating: Content.textbundle/assets/textbundle-logo.png
	  inflating: Content.textbundle/text.md
	  inflating: Content.textbundle/info.json

Now, a TextBundle contains three main components:
1. The text itself stored in `text.*`.
2. Metadata about the bundle stored in `info.json`.
3. Assets used within the text stored as separate files inside the `assets/` folder.
Metadata is mostly optional except for one thing: It has to specify the format-version of the bundle. At this point, version 2 is the latest and also used by Ulysses:

	{
	  "creatorURL" : "file:\/\/\/Applications\/UlyssesMac.app\/",
	  "transient" : false,
	  "type" : "net.daringfireball.markdown",
	  "creatorIdentifier" : "com.ulyssesapp.mac",
	  "version" : 2
	}

`type` is optional but defaults to `net.daringfireball.markdown` for backwards-compatibility. Theoretically, a bundle could contain multiple text files with different extensions but handling of such a case seems not to be specified by spec.

Since I might want to integrate Ulysses into my blogging workflow and TextBundle sounds like a decent exchange format, I started playing around with implementing a little [Go library for reading TextPack files](https://github.com/zerok/textbundle-go):

	> r, _ := textbundle.OpenReader("Working with TextBundles.textpack")
	> fmt.Println(string(r.Text))
	
	# Working with TextBundles
	...
	
	> for _, a := range r.Assets {
	>   fmt.Println(a.Name)
	> }
	textbundle-logo.png

As a little experiment Iâ€™ve also created a little `import-textbundle` command for my blog that uses this library ðŸ™‚
