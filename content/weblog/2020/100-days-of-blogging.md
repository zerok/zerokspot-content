Today marks the final day of [\#100DaysToOffload challenge](https://zerokspot.com/tags/100daystooffload/) for me. For the last 100 days - ever since [27 April](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/04/27/lamy-accent-ef-fountain-pen/) - I‚Äôve been publishing at least one post here every single day. It‚Äôs been great fun and despite some concerns if I‚Äôd be able to actually see it to its completion, I managed to do it!

That being said, I‚Äôm not going to continue at this pace but I also won‚Äôt return to old habits of only writing here every once in a while. Instead, I will try to find a middle-ground with hopefully some more detailed technical post returning while still also publishing some ‚Äúlong-form tweets‚Äù. If those last 100 days have taught me one thing, it‚Äôs that I still love writing here and I see no reason to stop üòÖ I‚Äôve also got to know a lot of ‚Äúnew‚Äù folks and their own blogs that have found their way into my daily to-read list!

The challenge has also made me invest more into my writing toolchain with some [custom integrations for Ulysses](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/20/writing-blog-posts-using-ulysses/) but also helped me with exploring new hobbies/obsessions around writing in general.

Big thanks to [Kev](https://kevq.uk/) for starting the challenge and (among many others) [Hyde](https://lazybear.io/), [Jan-Lukas](https://jlelse.blog/), and [Mike](https://mikestone.me/) who‚Äôve kept me going.
