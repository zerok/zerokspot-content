So, yesterday was my first day back at a university nearly 11 years after my graduation. It was definitely weird sitting in a room where basically everyone except for the speaker was just a bit over half my age or at least appeared that way. I somehow simply felt totally out of place there but I hope this will only be temporarily.

As part of my curriculum I'm attending a course called "Technik - Ethik - Politik" ("Technology - Ethics - Politics") which puts a spotlight on the social effects of technology. As the title already indicates, that course is held in German. For some reason I hadn't realized that. Thanks to conferences and also my work so far, I've grown used to everything either being done in English or at least that a quick switch to English takes place if one of the attendees is struggling with the language. That's obviously not the case at a university. If the course is marked as German, it is held in German. Now I'll also have to write some short articles in German ... and read German literature. This will be even more strange 😅

As for finding my way around: All of Inffeldgasse 25 looks from the outside like one large construction site due to all entrance pathways being renovated/repaired at the same time. Combined with me basically only being there for the second time in my life, it took me quite a while to find the right room 😅 Now I just have to continue exploring a bit to find the best spots with working power outlets and where the coffee/cocoa machines are 😁
