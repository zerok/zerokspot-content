Starting today, restaurants in Austria are open again! There are a couple of restrictions (like there only being at most 4 people per table) but I really hope that they won’t prevent too many people from saving their favourite places either by going there or ordering from them. [It will probably take a while](https://steiermark.orf.at/stories/3048707/) for people to feel safe again but there is hope 🙂

This also means that my favourite brewery/restaurant in Graz, [Sudhaus](https://www.sudhaus.at/), is also available again and so I rode there this afternoon to grab some bottles of #1 beer, aptly named “Das Erste” (German: “The first one”), and also give their new wheat beer a try.
