This Thursday I went home to Klagenfurt to visit my Mum. While being in my old room I noticed an old Pelikan Level ink tank. I thought to myself: “If the tank is still there, perhaps my old school fountain pen is somewhere here too?” After a bit of rummaging through old boxes I found it! A good old Pelikan Level L65 in blue and black!

The German company Pelikan made these between [1997 and 2001](https://www.pelikan-collectibles.de/de/Pelikan/Modelle/Level-Serien/index.html) and they were great! Not because they looked fancy (they did not) but because they could hold 4ml of ink in its reservoir! For comparison, a normal ink cartridge holds around 1.4ml of ink. Refilling happens through a small valve at the back of the shaft. There you plug a tank in and squeeze it to push ink through the valve into the pen’s reservoir. 

Sadly, Pelikan stopped producing the Level line in 2001. On the plus side, I still have a half-full tank and that tank can be just unscrewed and refilled with whatever ink I want 😁

So now I have also a broad fountain pen with blue ink that might be useful for headings 😊
