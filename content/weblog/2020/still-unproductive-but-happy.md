Just a quick update: My laptop still hasnâ€™t returned from getting its keyboard replaced thanks to the infamous butterfly issue. This means that Iâ€™m restricted to using my iPad or my gaming PC with Windows 10 and where I'm simply to lazy to properly set up my SSH and PGP keys. And donâ€™t get me started on the default settings in VisualStudio Code on Windows with regards to the tab-key and things like jumping to the beginning and end of a line on Windows in general.

Luckily, learning for my certifications still works on that setup quite well and I have a proper excuse to play more games ðŸ˜‚ I might even finish the main storyline of Deus Ex eventually.

Can I please get my MBP back?! ðŸ˜­
