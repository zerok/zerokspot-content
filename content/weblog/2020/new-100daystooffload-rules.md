After giving the whole [#100DaysToOffload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com/) another thought with the collected experience of the first 3 weeks [Kev changed the goals](https://kevq.uk/100-days-to-offload-over-saturation/) from publishing 100 posts in 100 days to 100 posts in 365 days. This has the advantage that he and others can spend more time fine-tuning before publishing the posts. IMO that's a good step since it will also allow more people to participate without burning through ideas and burning out in the process!

Looking through my archives I've also noticed that I haven't written any overly long post in quite some time but I don't think that's related to the challenge. In fact, for me the original goals have worked very well and I will try to continue putting out at least one article every day for the remainder of the 100 days. That being said, with the new goals published I at least won't feel too bad when the day comes where I don't feel like writing anything ðŸ˜…
