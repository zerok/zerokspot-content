A couple of days ago, [Marcus Hermann](https://marcus.io/blog/making-rss-more-visible-again-with-slash-feeds) wrote a post suggesting that blogs should expose their RSS feeds and give a human-readable introduction about what content in available through which feed on a dedicated `/feeds` page. 

Technically, that information should already mostly be available through `<link rel="alternatve"...>` tags in a websiteâ€™s markup, but what about things like tag-specific feeds? If a website has hundreds or even thousands of tags, itâ€™s probably not all that user-friendly if you add a link-tag to every tag on every page ðŸ¤ª 

But also if your site has only one large feed, having a `/feeds`-page is a nice gesture, telling the visitor that you (a) donâ€™t mind if they primarily consume their content through a feed and (b) that youâ€™ve youâ€™ve even thought about that use-case.

You can find my /feeds page on â€¦ [/feeds](/feeds)ðŸ¥³

At the other end of the spectrum, quite frequently, though, I now also stumble across sites that say they have/are blogs but donâ€™t expose any RSS/Atom feed altogether; not via `<link>` nor with a button somewhere. In those situations Iâ€™ve now started to just send the authors a quick mail ðŸ™‚
