I don't know what kind of madness must have been at work in my head when I bought the latest book by former US National Security Advisor [John Bolton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton) titled “[The room where it happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room_Where_It_Happened)”. A republican writing about a madman/other republican is simply not something I'd normally even consider, and this will probably the first and last book about US politics for me at least for the foreseeable future.

I'm only about one third through but it's just painful that I'll probably celebrate the last page with a whole chocolate bar. Why don't I just quit? I think it's still extremely interesting to see the world from a completely different point of view. It's also quite an easy read as it is written somehow like a memory protocol of everything that happened from his point of view starting around the day Trump became president-elect in 2016. Easy yet painful.
