Since my good old PS4 is currently completely at its capacity harddisk-wise, I thought it would be time to finally also play some of those PS Plus games I had pilling up on it. The first game on that list was [Deus Ex: Mankind Divided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Mankind_Divided) which was free with PS Plus in [January 2018](https://blog.de.playstation.com/2017/12/27/playstation-plus-im-januar-mit-deus-ex-mankind-divided-und-batman-the-telltale-series/).

A quick disclaimer: I’m only about 80% through the story but I think I can still already have a proper opinion of the game.

Since this is my first Deus Ex game (after having only played the first one for a short time 20 years ago) I cannot really compare it to other entries of the city. That being said, I really enjoyed the story. The whole concept of augmented humans is just something that I find fascinating. What I didn’t enjoy, though, was part of the execution, especially the dialogs. The mimic of most of the side-characters simply felt far too much like talking cardboard boxes.

What the characters lacked in fluidity the gameplay more than made up for. Once you’re into a mission, the sneaking around, hacking devices, and (if you like) shooting your way through levels was great!

Sadly, and weirdly enough, despite its age it still has some serious performance issues especially in the hub-world areas probably due to all those fancy light effects (especially in the red-light district of Prague). This wasn’t an issue within the missions, though, so the framerate drops were just cosmetic issues.

So, overall, I had and still have a lot of fun with Deus Ex: Human Divided. Due to performance issues and really junky dialogs (despite great voice acting by Elias Toufexis) it’s only a good and not an outstanding game for me.

It still made me think if I shouldn’t just get a Playstation 4 Pro before it’s taken from the market eventually once the PS5 has entered the market. € 400 isn’t cheap, though...
