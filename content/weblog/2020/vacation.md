It's finally time to play returning ex-pat again and take a week off for some relaxing and swimming at [Wörthersee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rthersee) 😁 Thanks to COVID-19 many more people than usual  from Austria will probably do something similar with Wörthersee, Carinthia‘s largest lake, being usually one the most popular and prominent locations.

Luckily, thanks to my family being from Klagenfurt, I have good access to the lake and we're found a [hotel](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2019/08/19/vacations-in-carinthia/) that is in walking distance to that so we have basically the best of both world: great lake access + comfort of a hotel 😅

This also means that I'll probably be writing a little less for the next couple of days 😂
