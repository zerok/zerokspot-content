Due to scheduling conflicts I couldnâ€™t make it to GopherCon Europe this year but thanks to an email from the organisers I found out about [GoWayFest](https://goway.io/) which will take place in just a few days!

From July 11 to 12 there will be sessions and workshops from 14:00 until 18:00 UTC+2 from people like [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/), [Natalie Pistunovich](https://twitter.com/nataliepis), and [Mark Bates](https://twitter.com/markbates)!  [Tickets are available](https://goway.io/#tickets) for just â‚¬ 65 so what exactly are you waiting for again? ðŸ˜…
