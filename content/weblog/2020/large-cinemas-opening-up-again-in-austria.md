After the small independent cinemas which have been open since ... the Cineplexx group has now also announced that they'll open their buildings next Wednesday (5 August). Tickets on that first day will only cost â‚¬3 and include some free popcorn according [ORF.at](https://orf.at/stories/3175685/).

Looking through the [screening timetable at the Cineplexx in Graz-Puntigam](https://www.cineplexx.at/mobile/filme/kinoprogramm/) the following movies will be shown on that date:

- Body cam
- Playing with Fire
- Le meilleur reste Ã  venir
- My spy
- The current war
- Gretel & Hansel
- Guns Akimbo
- Into the Beat
- Meine Freundin Conni - Geheimnis um Kater Mau
- Narziss und Goldmund
- Paw Patrol: Mighty Pups -The Movie
- Sonic the Hedgehog
- The Secret: Dare to Dream
- Unhinged

Out of these I'm actually only interested in Guns Akimbo with Daniel Radcliffe. Sadly, I have an exam on the next morning so no cinema for me, and that when it's finally actually affordable again for once ðŸ¤ª
