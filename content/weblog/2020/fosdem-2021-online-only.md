I was still somehow hoping I'd have a reason to go to Brussels but since Wednesday it's been official: [FOSDEM 2021 is going to be online-only](https://fosdem.org/2021/news/2020-09-01-dates-fosdem-2021/). There are still discussions going on about the exact details but I'm pretty sure it's going to be awesome and there might even be [T-shirts](https://fosstodon.org/@fosdem/104798345396441459) 😀

In order to at least somehow recreate the experience of visiting Brussels in February I’m currently thinking about organising a little semi virtual meeting with friends with whom I’d normally have travelled. Let’s see if I can at least organise some proper waffles, Clubmate, Belgian beer, and some shared viewing sessions in the living room 😁
