[After 6 months of educational leave](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/02/28/sabbatical/) I've returned to work full-time today. This change back obviously didn't come with any change in scenery as home-office is still the default modus-operandi at Netconomy and probably will be so for the foreseeable future. Combined with some other changes it will probably take a bit of time before Iâ€™m used to fully working again  ðŸ˜†

To make the transition slightly easier I bought myself a little present (something I want to do more often in order to keep the spirit high): A black [Kaweco AL SPORT fountain pen](https://www.kaweco-pen.com/serien/al-sport/113/kaweco-al-sport-fuellhalter-schwarz?c=49) again with an EF nib. Iâ€™m probably write more about this little beauty in another post but a teaser is definitely in order ðŸ˜‰

Iâ€™m also trying to do bullet journaling for work-tasks. Same as six months ago, this will start out as a simple experiment which Iâ€™m going to evaluate every month or so. Iâ€™m really curious if and how this will work out but the first day was already quite promising especially thanks to the way I do time-tracking here ðŸ™‚ But more on the page-types and templates Iâ€™m using hopefully in a future post as they get refined over time.
