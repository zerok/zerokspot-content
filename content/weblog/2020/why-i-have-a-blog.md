After reading Kev Quirk’s post about [why he has a blog](https://kevq.uk/why-i-have-a-blog/) I searched through my archives and noticed that I hadn’t written a similar post in quite a while. So her’s the 2020-edition:

I’ve had this blog for nearly 16 years now. At first I used it mostly in a way you’d nowadays use Twitter: I linked to articles I found interesting or simply release notes of software I was using.

Since then my motivation changed a bit. I mostly use it now to organize my thoughts about certain topics. Sometimes it’s also simply that someone asked me a question and I anticipated others might benefit from a public answer, too, and so I put it up here. Oh, and just as [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) once said (paraphrasing here): there is something about just googling (with DuckDuckGo) a topic and your name to find out if you already once had an opinion about something  😅
