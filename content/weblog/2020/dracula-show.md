When I saw that a new show by [Mark Gatiss][m] and [Steven Moffat][s]
was available on Netflix, I knew I had to watch it as soon as
possible. The creative duo was also responsible for Sherlock and had
previously worked on shows like Doctor Who. In short, I'm a fan ;-)

In [Dracula][d], they now tell the origin story of the infamous
Vampire-Count from his time in Wallachia (now part of Romania) to his
fights with the Van Helsing family. Sadly, I haven't yet read Bram
Stoker's original so I cannot really say how much of the story in
the show is based on the book and how much is original.

What I *can* say, though, is that it received quite a modern twist and
the acting by [Claes Bang][c] as Dracula and [Dolly Wells][dw] as
Sister Agatha Van Helsing is brilliant. Dracula is charming, clever,
cultivated, strategic, and curious like I've never seen him
before. Sister Van Helsing is a worthy opponent for the Count with
pretty much the same characteristics. Together, they question and
partially explain some of the myths around the Vampire like why
Dracula is so disgusted by and afraid of the Christian cross.

They do so in a very bloody and - in places - extremely grotesque
manner. Obviously, Dracula lives from human blood but it never felt
like blood was spilled simply for getting more blood onto the screen,
though.

Slight spoiler ahead: As I expected, Gatiss and Moffat have produced
yet another extremely entertaining show! This time, though, the season
ends in a way that gives a lot of closure. I'm not sure that I'd want
another season after that unless there is a really good story to
explain it. That being said, I'm pretyt sure that the two of them
could pull it off and I would enjoy a second season!
