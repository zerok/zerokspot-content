Yesterday, [Gregory Hammond](https://gregoryhammond.ca/blog/why-people-dont-respond-when-you-ask-for-a-backlink-or-a-link-to-your-site/) wrote a great post about why people don’t respond when asked about adding a link to their site from yours. Every couple of days I get one of these mails by some agency. Most if not all of them look somehow auto-generated, reference really old posts of mine, and plug content that is only loosely related to what I originally wrote.

At one point, someone contacted me about a post I wrote in 2005 about a Zen Garden-inspired design I created. From the content of that mail I can only guess that the author doesn’t really know what [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is as she asked me to help safe butterflies 🤷‍♂️

While I still at least read over every e-mail I get, I’ve yet to see one of these pitches that actually provided any added-value to me. For this reason I’ve mostly switched my brain into a delete-first-ask-later mode. This *does not* mean that I don’t value *actual* feedback and suggestions! 

*Please send me feedback!*

But if you do then please at least make sure that you’re talking about the same topic as the post you’re referencing 🙂 And if you link to an article in your comment that I think will benefit those that read my blog (including my future self) then I usually update the relevant posts!
