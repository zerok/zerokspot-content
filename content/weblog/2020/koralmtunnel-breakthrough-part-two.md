In my opinion one of the most important if not even *the* most important infrastructure project in Austria [reached another milestone yesterday](https://steiermark.orf.at/stories/3052399/): Works on [the tunnel connecting Styria and Carinthia through Koralm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koralm_Tunnel) have finally had their second literal breakthrough. Now, 18 years after the first test drills, both tunnel tubes, around 33km each, are finally actual tubes ðŸ˜„

This tunnel is part of a huge project that should drastically improve train connections from Austriaâ€™s capital Vienna to the two souther states, trimming the travel time from Klagenfurt (capital of Carinthia) to Vienna through that and another tunnel connecting Styria and Lower Austria from around 4 hours to 2 hours 40 minutes! For me personally the travel time from Graz (Styrian capital) and Klagenfurt will be more than cut in half (from 2h to 45 minutes)! Just 5 more years to wait ðŸ˜£ Similarly, Iâ€™ll be able to get to Vienna much quicker once the Semmering-Basis-Tunnel will be completed (and the rails through it, scheduled for 2027).

Letâ€™s see if those tunnels will also fix the non-existing network reception around Semmering ðŸ˜‚
