Similar to things like [Project 365](https://www.flickr.com/groups/project365/) et al. [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/100-days-to-offload/) suggested via Mastodon a new challenge: 100 days of consecutive blog posts. More than 10 years ago I actually wanted to take a photo every single day of the year but after only [26 days](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/albums/72157608267993947) I gave up. Looking back, I'm shocked to notice that I actually used that Coolpix S700 for something, but I digress.

Perhaps the biggest difference between a photo challenge and one for blogging is that I can prepare articles in advance. I often have multiple ideas for posts at the same time and just create multiple drafts to be refined over the next days. With something like Project 365 and a medium like pictures it's not that easy.

The core idea of both is the same though: Just document whatever you're interested in/passionate about. Quality is secondary as the focus should be on getting into the habit of it:

> Posts donâ€™t need to be long-form, deep, meaningful, or even that well written. If there are spelling and grammar mistakes, or even if thereâ€™s no real point to the post, so what? Whatâ€™s important is that youâ€™re writing about the things you want to write about.

Additionally, 100DaysToOffload is a much shorter challenge so I might actually be able to make it this time. Kev also created a website dedicated to it on <https://100daystooffload.com/> where he [lists some of the participating blogs](https://100daystooffload.com/blogroll.html) and also links to the tags on various social networks. This should be enough to give you an idea of what you could write about in case you want to join us ðŸ™‚
