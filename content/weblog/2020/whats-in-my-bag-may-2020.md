I havenâ€™t posted my daily load out for quite some time so I thought it was time again! I tend to use one of three bags depending on what I want to transport (or plan to do for the day) I pick up one of the following three:

1. Peak Design Everyday Sling 6l
2. Timbuk 2 Command (ca 2016)
3. Timbuk 2 Especial Tres (ca 2013)

## When what?

My new default is the smallest: The Everyday Sling [which I reviewed recently](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/24/first-look-peak-design-everyday-sling-6l/). If I plan to work from somewhere other than my apartment I take the [Command messenger](https://www.timbuk2.com/products/174-command-messenger-bag-sale) and if I need to transport a lot, I take the [Especial Tres](https://www.carryology.com/reviews-2/road-test/bag-review-timbuk2-especial-tres/).

## The Minimalist

In this post I want to focus on whatâ€™s in my Sling bag, since this is my default and the others have pretty much the same in them but simply replace the camera with a laptop (and whatever else I need to transport).

For situations where I just need the bare minimum of stuff with me, I use a Peak Design Everyday Sling 6l (black). In there I have the following items:

- Passport / Photo ID
- iPad (7th gen)
- [Logitech Keys-to-go keyboard](https://www.logitech.com/de-de/product/keys-to-go?crid=1762)
 - My journal ([Leuchtturm 1917 A5](https://www.leuchtturm1917.de/notizbuch-medium-a5-hardcover-251-nummerierte-seiten.html), dotted, hardcover)
- [Leuchtturm 1917 notepad](https://www.leuchtturm1917.de/reporterblock-pocket-a6-hardcover-94-nummerierte-seiten.html) (squared)
- My fountain pen ([Lamy accent](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/04/27/lamy-accent-ef-fountain-pen/)), [Uniball mechanical pencil](https://uniballco.com/uni-products/kuru-toga/), fine liners
- Neutrogena hand creme
- Sony NEX 6 with 18-105mm lens which I can clip onto the outside of the bag
- [Anker Powercore II 20000](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-ii-20000/A1260011) (which is enough for charging my phone and iPad multiple times) including an [Anker PowerLine+ 6ft lightning cable](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powerline--6ft-lightning/B8122091)
- Not in the picture: Apple Camera-Lightning adapter for getting pictures from the camera onto the iPad for post-processing and uploading

The iPad combined with the external keyboard allows me to pretty much do anything except for coding. With the right adapters I can even post-process the pictures from my camera and write and publish blog posts.

The underside of the bag also has two straps that I use to carry a light rain-jacket or weather-proof hoodie with me just in case ðŸ™‚
