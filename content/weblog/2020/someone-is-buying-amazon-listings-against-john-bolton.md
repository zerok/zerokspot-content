Yesterday, I was somehow motivated and looked for [John Bolton’s book “The Room Where It Happened”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room_Where_It_Happened) on the German edition of Amazon. While the listing produced for the term “john bolton the room where it happened” included the book in #1 on the desktop, it was only #3 on my phone with the first two spots being sponsored placements of books that list “Donald J. Trump” as their author. Trump’s campaign team has to be quite desperate when they start buying ad placements on Amazon.de. Oh, and if you only look for “john bolton” then these other books are not even in the top 20 results. Desperate and cheap, I guess …

If that’s really his campaign team, then they probably didn’t tell their boss that they just sent Jeff Bezos some money for a far too specific search-term 🤣
