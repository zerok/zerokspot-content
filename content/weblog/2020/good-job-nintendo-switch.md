About a week ago I decided I had to do something about my pile-of-shame for video games. Heck, I still have the latest [God of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)) game for the PS4 lying around here somewhere in its original shrink-wrap, I still pay for Playstation Plus even though I haven’t even switched my PS4 on in months or played anything since finishing the awesome [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/12/16/horizon-zero-dawn/).

As a first step, I wanted to finish some of the games I have for the Nintendo Switch. Animal Crossing isn’t something you can finish so I focused for the last couple of days on another game I had bought around the time AC was released: [Good Job!](https://www.nintendo.at/Spiele/Nintendo-Switch-Download-Software/Good-Job--1748054.html)

The game is about a new employee in a company that should finish minor tasks like bringing workers to a certain room for a presentation. Each level is a big sandbox where you can pretty much do anything as long as you finish the primary task:

In the screenshot above you see a level where I had to heat up specific rooms by redirecting hot water accordingly. As the spilled water indicates, I didn’t care all that much about anything else 😅

Another level had me set up Wi-Fi for all employees of a department using access points and range extenders:

This also hints at the highlight of the game: Power cables. When you connect them to a far-away appliance then you can use them like a slingshot to cause all sorts of mayhem! Sadly, that mayhem comes at a price: frame-rate. Especially when hundreds of objects are flying around it takes a huge hit! The game is still playable but the frame-rate feels like in the single-digits.

The other issue I had with this game were its controls. It’s far too easy to get stuck especially when you’re driving a forklift or something similar around. In those situations I had to either reset my player (since this option exists I’m pretty sure that the developers were aware of that issue) or try to turn in circles for a minute or two and hope to get free again. 

That being said, these were my *only issues* with the game and they didn’t distract too much from the pure joy of running around, fixing Wi-Fi, and causing destruction in the process 😅 At € 20 it’s at the upper end of what I’d be willing to pay for a “small” game like this, but I definitely had far less fun with pricier titles that offered far less content 😉

Due to the frame-rate issues and the issues with the controls Good Job! gets a **4 out of 5** from me 🙂

Next: Finishing some of these really good Apple Arcade games 😅
