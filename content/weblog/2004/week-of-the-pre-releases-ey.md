title: Week of the pre-releases ey?
---


<p><img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/tb09.jpg" class="left" alt=""/>This week quite a lot of new pre-releases appeared on the Internet starting with the first PR of Gimp 2.2 and now also Thunderbird 0.9 was released by its developers. Not to forget the 2nd release candidate of Mozilla Firefox 1.0 ;-) Perhaps I should really start to automate the installation of such things *g*</p>
