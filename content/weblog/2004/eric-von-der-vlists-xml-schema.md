<p><img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/oreilly-xmlschema.jpg" alt="Bookshot" class="left"/>Well, I thought I'd need XML schema in future projects (and perhaps also in current ones and for work) I ordered this book last friday and it finally arrived this morning :-) Let's see how long it will take me to finish it, but the book (at least what I read until now) is really nice. Within its more than 400 pages there is certainly enough to learn for me about XSD. The first 30 pages included probably around 80% of what I knew about XML schema until today ;-)</p>
