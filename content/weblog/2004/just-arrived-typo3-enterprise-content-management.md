title: 'Just arrived: Typo3 - Enterprise Content Management'
---


<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/book-typo3.jpg" class="left" alt=""/>I really like Amazon. They are fast and I never had any problems with them. Just today another of my ordered products has arrived: The book "Typo3 - Enterprise Content Management" by Werner Altmann, Renß© Fritz and Daniel Hinderink. Since I first saw and tried Typo3 I was astonished by its complexity and functionality. But the complexity also kept me on a distance from this CMS. Now I want to learn how to use, to extend and to alter it. That's why I've ordered this book also because it got really good marks by readers on <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3937514015/qid=1102616197/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/302-8688307-8527209">amazon.de</a>.

I'm still reading <a href="http://weblog.zerokspot.com/posts/123/">"Web Standard Solutions" by Dan Cederholm</a> but I hope I will get to this book tonight or tomorrow evening :-)
