<p>Today the Mozilla project released with Mozilla Firefox 1.0PR a preview release for the upcoming browser Mozilla Firefox 1.0. It contains several improvements for example a lightweight RSS integration. For more details please read the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/0.10.html" title="Firefox 0.10 release notes">release notes</a> :-)</p>


<p>Also Mozilla's email client <em>Thunderbird</em> got an update today. The new Thunderbird 0.8 for example includes an RSS reader.</p>

<p><strong>Both programs are available on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla.org</a></strong></p>

<p>The Mozilla project also launched a new site that should help spreading word about Firefox: <strong><a href="http://spreadfirefox.com">SpreadFirefox.com</a></strong> So if you want to help making Firefox more known all over the world, this would be a good starting point for you :-)</p>
