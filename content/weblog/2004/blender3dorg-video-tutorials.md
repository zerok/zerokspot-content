I just noticed that Blender.org now also offers some really nice video tutorials for beginners. As I never found the time to get the Blender book and read it this is really great for me :-) I just watched the "Getting Started" Â» "Vital Functions" and it really goes into detail... The video is around 30MB just for introducing how load, save and rendering works.
