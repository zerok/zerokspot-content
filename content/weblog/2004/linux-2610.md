title: Linux 2.6.10

Ok, seems like Linux 2.6.10 has been released yesterday. To bad there is no MM-patchset for this release out yet otherwise I could update (Reiser4 partitions ;-) ). After having problems with the keyboard drivers in the release candidates on multiple machines I'm really curious if they work in the final release WITH all ACPI options enabled ;-)
