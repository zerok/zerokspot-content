title: QuirksMode - for all your browser quirks
---


<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/quirksmode.jpg" alt="" class="left"/>I just found this site while searching for a solution to  a small problem I had with the background-position attribute in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. This site is really huge, not to say enourmous. Peter-Paul Koch's site is about browser incompatibilites esp. regarding CSS and JavaScript  (and so also the <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym>). He describes these incompatibilites in detail and also offers solutions and work-arounds for these problems.

-------------------------------



According to its google page rank this site is already well known, so I'm probably writing here only to myself, but... Thank you Mr Koch for this great resource :-)
