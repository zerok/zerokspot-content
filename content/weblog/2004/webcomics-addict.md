title: Webcomics addict?
---


Thanks to my illness during the last couple of days I had enough time to read the episodes of PvP I missed during the last year ... let's say 75% or the strips. It took me about 2 days and then ... I had nothing to read anymore :-( And as pennyarcade was also down back then I noticed something that I probably wouldn't have noticed without these two facts: <em>I'm perhaps a webcomic-addict *g*</em>
I mean, one of the first things I do in the morning right after getting out of my bed is to check if there's a new PvP-strip online. I somehow just love those fights between Skull and Brent. Perhaps I should really order a T-shirt ....

<p>Do you perhaps some similar experience? Posting here is cheaper than talking to a psychiatrist ;-)
