<img src="/media/2004/firefox10rc1.jpg" alt="" class="left"/>The first release candidate of the upcoming Mozilla Firefox 1.0 has now appeared on ftp.mozilla.org :-) There are now already packages in french, english, german, spanish, polish, czech, greek and norwegian available. This is just the current state :-)

-------------------------------

Like with the PR old extensions are again disabled (with old I mean for example those that worked with the preview release ;-) ).

<strong><a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0rc1/">ftp.mozilla.org</a></strong>

<strong>Edit:</strong> The extensions seem to work. There is just a message that you have old extensions installed.
