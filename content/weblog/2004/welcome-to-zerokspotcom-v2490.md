title: Welcome to zerokspot.com v2.4.90
---


Yesterday evening I had some free hours so I decided to play around with the style of zs.com again. First of all I wanted to get rid of the zs-navigation in the right sidebar and to make a common header and footer for all the sites on zs.com. I've now also added rounded corners to site. I hope you like it :-)

-------------------------------



Why 2.4.90? Simply because this still is far away from being finished and I still have to restyle the galelry and the docs. That's why these two sections aren't included in the menu yet :-)
