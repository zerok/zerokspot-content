-------------------------------



Another game for those people out there, who have a flash-plugin installed in their browser(s) ;-)

I had no time to view the intro or play the game longer than 2 minutes but it really looks nice. It has more or less the same style as those good old Double Dragon games (also with a boss at the end of at least the first level ;-) )
