Two days ago I finally got my two Ayumi Hamasaki CDs from YesAsia.com and both are really great.

<ul>
<li><strong>I am</strong>: Released in 2002 it includes at least one song I know that was released also in Europe ("Connected"). It also includes "Dearest" which is part of the InuYasha-Soundtrack. For those among you that don't know InuYasha: That's an anime series (<a href="http://dmoz.org/Arts/Animation/Anime/Titles/I/Inu-Yasha/">InuYasha@dmoz</a>). It's a quite rocky album but also offers some slow tunes like "Endless sorrow"</li>
<li><strong>Memorial address</strong>: Her current album released last December. It only includes 8 songs, but that's enough if there is also something like the "Angel's song" or "Because of you" among them :-) 

There is also an edition available that includes a DVD. On this one you get the music videos for 7 of the 8 songs ("Memorial address" itself got now video :-( )</li>
</ul>

After listening to these two CDs all day long (quite simple when you're ill *g* ) I'm quite sure, that I will also order most of her other CDs (most because of the cost-factor :-( ).
