title: New hardware for me on the horizon
---


As my current PC at home is a little slow for the thing I use it for (compiling, folding@home - in general: working) I plan to spend some money on new hardware. I currently have following stuff in it:

-------------------------------

* AMD Thunderbird 1200MHz

* Asus A7V Mainboard

* 768MB SDRAM

* GeForce Ti5200

* Soundblaster Live 5.1 Platinum

* NEC 2500A DVD burner

* some NEC DVD reader

* 2 ethernet cards (10/100M)

* a 120GB HDD



Things I want to get:

* <a href="http://www.geizhals.at/a125576.html">Intel Pentium 4 with 3GHz</a>

* 1GB DDR2 RAM PC530

* a fitting mainboard with AGP slot (... could someone please explain to me why I can't find any mainboards with AGP slots for Socket 775?)

* <a href="http://www.geizhals.at/a32238.html">Blacknoise Noiseblocker CWT-480, 480W ATX power supply</a>



If I can't find a mainboard with an AGP slot I will perhaps have to get a PCIe card :-( In this case I will probably get a GeForce 6600 or GeForce 6600 GT with 128MB RAM. I just wish I could keep my old card simply because I don't intend to use the machine for playing but still don't want to have to fight with ATI drivers ;-)
