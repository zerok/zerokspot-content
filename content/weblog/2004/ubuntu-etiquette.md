<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/ubuntuetiquette.jpg" class="left"/>Nothing to blog today? Well, actually the day was quite nice: Christmas party, got a 2L beer bottle etc. :-) 

-------------------------------



But to keep it constructive: Yesterday evening an anonymous user posted a link to Andy Fitzsimon's ubuntu-site. There he has posted some really nice  artwork and gives also a preview to the (hopefully soon) next release of the etiquette icon set ... or should we call it theme by now? ;-)



I already loved the last few releases of the etiquette icon set so I'm really looking forward to this whole etiquette theme, no matter for what distribution it will be released :-) The screenshots actually got me to the point where I want to give ubuntu a try. I just have one problem: None of my machines is broken enough for a reinstallation, so I'll just wait a little longer :-)
