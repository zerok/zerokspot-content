<a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2004/11/24/">Number One in China: Red Flag Offers Opera to Chinese Users</a>

-------------------------------



In the last months it got quite quiet about the nordern browser. Everyone was talking about the new Firefox releases and how their market share increased. But now Opera Software seems to have got a deal that could increase their user count by millions. 



When RedFlag starts to bundle Opera with their Linux Distribution which is more or less sponsored (AFAIK) by the chinese government it could really lead Opera to a new (and quite amazing) high. 



Ok, I'm a Firefox user and am using Mozilla based browsers since M16 (IIRC) but I'm not one of thse people that sticks with just one solution so I always have an eye on Opera (as I don't like ads in the apps I'm using I even have 2 licenses ;-) ). And I really wish Opera Software luck with this deal :-)
