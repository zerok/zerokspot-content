title: Some changes
---


As you've perhaps already noticed there are some new things on zerokspot.com. For example the slightly altered design (with the blue gradient in the main menu) and some small things like a games-collection listing or a listing of university courses I attend/attended. There I will probably also release some homeworks and things like that if someone needs them :-)

--------------

I finally also had some time to integrate the articles into the main page's design.

## About the gallery

I currently have little motivation to also change the design in there too. Perhaps this will happen within the next month or so.
