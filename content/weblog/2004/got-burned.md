<p><ins><img src="http://weblog.zerokspot.com/wp-content/burnout3.jpg" alt="Burnout3 Packshot" class="left"/></ins>Hehe, today I finally got my hands on Burnout 3 for the XBox. The game was released 2 days back in the USA and today here in Austria. To bad that the PS2 version was delayed until next week but anyway: Here it is :-) After some hours of playing I still really like it. For me it's like a mixture of Burnout 2 and SSX3 because of  the whole EA flair ... well,  the EA flair was definitely better in SSX3 ;-) Somehow the soundtrack isn't really that great (good that there is  the possibility to get a custom soundtrack on the XBox) and the DJ is ... ok, he's fun but if you have to here his comments for the 3rd time in a row (!!!): No tnx.</p>

<p>If I find some time I'll probably write a detailed review on gamerslog.com :-) Stay tuned.</p>
