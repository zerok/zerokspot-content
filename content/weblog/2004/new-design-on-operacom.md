title: New design on opera.com

<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera.com</a>

-------------------------------



<p><img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/newoperacom.jpg" alt="New opera.com look" class="left"/>Seems like Opera Software has given their website a small redesign. Now the site presents itself in a quite stylish silver look that is at least for me much better readable than the old red-blue look. The community pages have not (yet) been redesigned but hopefully will get the new design too :-)</p>

<p>Opera.com now also has an RDF file available <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/rdf.pl" title="RDF>here</a>. I don't know if it already had this before; I didn't notice it :-)</p>
