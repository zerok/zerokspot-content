I just wanted to say "Thank you" to all the people on the gentoo board that made this great <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=49036&highlight=bootsplash" title="Bootsplash tutorial on the official gentoo board">collection of bootsplash tutorials</a> :-) (Esp. to Narada who has started this topic).
