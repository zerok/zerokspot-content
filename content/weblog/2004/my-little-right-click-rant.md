title: My little right click rant ;-)
---


Or better "my little right-click-block rant". Everyday I come across sites where right clicking is disabled. Someone must have told these sites' owners that this will protect their content or something... yeah, perhaps from people who are only every two years or so.

People, wake up please. This keeps no one from getting your images but just annoys people who by accident hit the right mouse button or are using mouse gestures.
