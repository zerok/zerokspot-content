title: Intro slides for Django
---


<img src="/media/2012/slides-welcome.png" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 10px 10px" alt="" />If you want to give an introductory presentation on [Django](http://djangoproject.com) and are still missing the slides for it, don't look any further! Markus [released on Friday](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101035329957602288456/posts/84rVWGj2Bmr) a set of slides giving a brief overview of what Django is, what it has to offer and where it is used.

**[To the slides](https://bitbucket.org/keimlink/django-introduction)**

Right now the slides are only available in German but an English translation seems to be on the roadmap :-) Nice use of [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) :D
