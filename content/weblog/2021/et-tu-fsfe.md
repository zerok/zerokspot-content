In [yesterday’s post](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/03/22/rms-is-back-on-the-fsf-board/) I wrote that the FSFE has a more modern image compared to the FSF. I got that impression after seeing them every year at FOSDEM and the Chaos Communication Congress, and also following at least some of their work (e.g. [Public Money? Public Code!](https://fsfe.org/activities/publiccode/publiccode.en.html)).

Thanks to [this toot by @phreaknerd@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@phreaknerd/105938642868177233) I discovered a plethora of other stories about the organisation regarding how [volunteers are treated](https://debian.community/google-influence-free-open-source-software-community-threats-sanctions-bullying/) and the communication style of and [treatment of employees in general](https://write.as/malinagalina/i-took-fsfe-to-court) by some of their management according to various personal accounts. 

After reading these and other stories as well as some discussions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naderman/status/1374273623448518657) and Mastodon I’ve decided to stop donating to the FSFE. As I wrote yesterday, I think the core values of Free Software are important but there is simply no place (in such a movement or anywhere) for discrimination, sexism, harassment, nor any other form of toxicity. If the FSFE shows or tolerates such behaviour, I don’t want to support them. It also doesn’t help that they haven’t yet commented on RMS returning to the FSF and that they [haven’t distanced themselves clearly in 2019](https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20190917-01.en.html).

Let’s see what the future might bring but that’s the way it looks to me right now. Perhaps things will change. I’ll be waiting.
