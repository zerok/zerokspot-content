I have no idea what is going on right now but over the course of the last two weeks I and everyone around me has been more and more on the edge. It seems like we are finally running out of patience; not with the measures against COVID-19 or the governments and politicians that work on those but simply the overall situation of isolation from friends and family. Yes, video calls are great, but Iâ€™m really missing those evenings where we could just sit around a table in a nice restaurant, drink some beer, eat some pizza together. 

These days will come back. We will - once again - meet each other and explore Amsterdam, Budapest, Brussels, Paris, Portland, Prague, â€¦ together. Weâ€™ll just have to wait some more, be a bit more patient, and protect as many people as possible through masks, vaccines, and treatments.

Iâ€™m tired, exhausted, frustrated. None of these feelings will help though, so Iâ€™ll replace them with as many [small treats](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/02/11/new-pen-day-twsbi-diamond-580alr-nickel-gray/) as are necessary ðŸ™‚
