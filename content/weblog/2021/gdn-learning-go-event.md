Next week, [GoGraz][] is going to be slightly different than usual. The [Go
Developer Network][gdn] (which is also paying our Meetup.com bills right now)
is organizing a remote event on January 27th.

Starting at 13:00 GMT-5 (I think that's 19:00 UTC+2) there will be talks
focused around how various people learnt Go and/or are still learning. Right now
7 of those are scheduled from folks working at companies like HashiCorp or the New
York Times.

You can find the whole event schedule on the [GoBridge event
page](https://www.meetup.com/gobridge/events/275562079/). If you are already a
GoGraz member, we also have a [mirror event for
you](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/275830938/) ðŸ™‚

P.S.: There are some things that need to be announced regarding GoGraz itself
but these are for another time.
