Originally, I wanted to spend some time today to get to know the [HAR file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) in detail and also implement a little library in Go for parsing it according to the spec. Before I got to that, though, we decided to get some fresh air and take a quick walk. Just before we went through the door, though, we noticed that we had forgotten to buy new cat litter and so the the walk turned into a small trip by bike down to the airport since the grocery store there has open also on Sundays. 

Back home, we both started wondering how long getting back had taken us. Obviously, none of us had looked at their watch and so I started digging through my [geotrace](https://github.com/zerok/geotrace) logs. Some time later I had not only learnt the answer to that question but also played around with [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) for the first time in 15 years and with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in order to build a little UI in front of the geotrace database. Thatâ€™s where [this commit](https://github.com/zerok/geotrace/commit/44bed10b7c9769604869c0ba45536274e265f331) is coming from ðŸ™ƒ

Now I could finally check when I had left the airport and when Iâ€™ve reached the apartment complex. If youâ€™re curious: It takes 21 minutes with headwind ðŸ˜…

I guess, I will get to HAR another time if I don't start cleaning up the front-end mess I made today first ðŸ˜…
