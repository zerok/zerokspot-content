Ever since Iâ€™ve stumbled upon the Sony A7C I want to spend more time taking pictures again. Iâ€™m currently using a Sony NEX-6 which I bought back in 2012 and has served me really well over the years. I think there have only been very few vacations since 2012 where that camera wasnâ€™t at least somewhere inside my luggage.

During the pandemic and with me no longer traveling around the world to attend half a dozen tech-conferences every year, Iâ€™ve somehow forgot about my camera (except for that one holiday trip last summer) and pretty much lost all my skills (if I even ever had any). Enough with that! Last week Iâ€™ve finally pulled out my [small camera bag](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/24/first-look-peak-design-everyday-sling-6l/) out of the closet, [clipped](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture) the camera onto it, and now whenever I go for a walk, the NEX-6 is with me again.

Once I have fun with it again, I might even consider finally upgrading my camera after 9 years. I have no idea if I really want to go full-frame but letâ€™s wait and see.

For the time being Iâ€™ve also reactivated [my Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/). Iâ€™ve had that account for 15 years now and since I pay for it, I might as well use it ðŸ™ƒ Eventually I will probably move to something else that I can host myself (perhaps Pixelfed, perhaps something else entirely). As with the new camera, though, this depends first and foremost whether or not I will use my equipment enough to warrant that step.
