A couple of days ago, [Cory Doctorow celebrated 20 years of him blogging](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd) with a look back and offering a look into his daily process of publishing content onto his current link blog [pluralistic.net](https://pluralistic.net/) after leaving BoingBoing about a year ago

The amount of effort he puts the process is just nothing but inspiring to me! Heck, if I publish anything here I’m sometimes not even motivated enough to proof-read it and don’t get me started on images! That being said, I should probably really start adding more images to my posts. More diagrams but also more “generic” graphics from public domain/CC sources.

He also spends a lot of time, thought, and effort publishing his posts on Twitter and Mastodon. Similar to how the content is presented on the blog it is split into multiple status messages attached to a single thread per day 😍

Something else that I absolutely love about Pluralistic and BoingBoing is that they are classic link blogs with both also adding lots of commentary and analysis to the original links. Perhaps I should also try that from time to time 😅

Anyway, congratulations and thank you so much for all your hard work 🤩
