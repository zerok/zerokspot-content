Sometimes you just have to rewatch a movie in order to appreciate it. A couple of years ago I had watched [Netflixâ€™ Spectral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral) and have felt it to be quite underwhelming. Today I saw it again and to my surprise quite enjoyed it. I cannot really explain it but I remembered a totally different ending, as if it had been completely recut since then.

Now I wonder what other movies I might just need to rewatch in order to appreciate. I probably still will never enjoy the Lord of the ring series (awesome movies but simply not for me) but perhaps I should just compile a list of sci-fi movies and comedies that I have bad memories of in order to give them a second chance. Just to name a few:

- Mars Attack
- Alien 3
- Judge Dredd

What are some of your movies that you have bad memories of but are otherwise liked by some of your friends?
