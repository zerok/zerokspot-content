My first contact with Austrian comedy (‚ÄúKabarett‚Äù) was back in the 1990s thanks to various parodies of the Olympic Winter Games by [Mini Bydlinski](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Bydlinski). Then I somehow took the wrong turn for me and simply didn‚Äôt come across anybody that I really enjoyed listening to until last summer. We started watching various TV broadcasts featuring [Alex Kristan](https://www.alexkristan.at/) and [Gery Seidl](http://www.geryseidl.at/) and I was hooked again.

In October then came my personal highlight: My first visit of a live-performance on a tiny cellar-stage in [Vienna](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/10/27/visiting-vienna-during-a-panedemic/) where [Fl√ºsterzweieck](https://fluesterzweieck.at/) showed an alpha-version of their next show. It was so alpha that they read half of the text from their phones which just added to the flair üòä

But then the next lockdowns happened and I was once again stuck behind a TV set. Luckily, there is now a relatively new streaming service by the ORF focusing on Austrian productions: [Flimmit](https://flimmit.at/). It‚Äôs ‚Ç¨39.99 per year (or ‚Ç¨3.99 per month) and not only offers local crime-shows but also lots of comedy by, among others, Alex Kristan, [Michael Niavarani](http://www.niavarani.at/), Gery Seidl, [Viktor Gernot](http://www.viktorgernot.at/)! So far, well worth it!
