I’m really not sure what I should think of [this book by Mark Manson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck). It’s basically a self-help book where the author tries to help you focus on topics that are important as opposed to always aiming for constant happiness by jumping from one “high” to another. There are some good points in there but most of the book was anecdotal stuff with while references left and right.

Some of these stories that acted as a wrapper were still entertaining, others were just weird and cringe-worthy at best or borderline misogynistic at worst. The bro-culture felt strong with this one…
