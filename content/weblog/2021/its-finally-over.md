I've been waiting for this day for four years and [today it has finally
come][ina]. There are too many emotions welling up inside of me despite being
completely destroyed after a long work-day and then holding a team coding dojo
in the evening, but these are primarily for my personal journal.

All that I want to say today is this: Good luck, President Biden and
Vice-President Harris! Hopefully you can bring peace to your country but also
rebuild the bridges to Europe and the rest of the world that your predecessors
tore down and set on fire.
