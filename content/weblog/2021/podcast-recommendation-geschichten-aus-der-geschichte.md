Over the last months I’ve expanded my podcast library a bit. One of the “oddballs” in my normally quite tech-centric playlist is the German podcast [“Geschichten aus der Geschichte”](https://www.geschichte.fm/) in which two historians, Daniel Meßner and Richard Hemmer, each week tell one another a story about a historical person or event.

They are now at more than 280 episodes and just recently covered, for instance, the fake Spanish (because British) dancer [Lola Montez](https://www.geschichte.fm/podcast/gag283/) or the [attempted coup in Spain in 1981](https://www.geschichte.fm/podcast/gag281/).

If you know German, this one is well worth your time! Since each episode only takes between 40 and 60 minutes it’s also a manageable time-investment 🙃
