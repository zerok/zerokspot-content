A couple of days ago Matt Birchler wrote a post titled [‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to write nice things‚Äù](https://birchtree.me/blog/its-hard-to-write-nice-things/) in which he describes how getting creative when you want to show something is bad is actually the easy way out. Same as him I‚Äôve always tried to stay positive, to focus on the good things in life. 

Sure, from time to time I also write a little rant or a negative review but I try to at least provide constructive feedback (at least with the review, with the rant probably not so much). If I‚Äôve failed to do so with one of my posts in the past, please let me know! Not everything in the world is great but, in my opinion, providing constructive feedback is a positive action with the goal of making things better.

That article just reminded me that I should always keep that goal in mind even while being in a completely rant-mood üòÖ
