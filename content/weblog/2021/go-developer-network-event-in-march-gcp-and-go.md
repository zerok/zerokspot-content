After their [awesome event in January](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/01/28/my-first-gdn-event/), GoBridge is hosting another evening full of Go-talks as part of the GDN on [2021-03-17 (Wednesday)](https://www.meetup.com/gobridge/events/276379278/) starting at 10:00 PDT / 18:00 Europe/Vienna. At this point the schedule contains 6 talks:

- Go and Google App Engine (by Matthew Holiday - The New York Times)
- Go webapp serverless options in GCP (Valentin Deleplace - Google)
- Gotchas using Go to reduce the spread of COVID (Seth Vargo -  Google Cloud)
- Go, Cloud Functions and Cloud Tasks (Fred Gurnot - The New York Times)
- From Python to Go on GCP (Steve Coffman - Khan Academy)
- Implementing and Deploying a Cloud Function in Go (Misha Avrekh - The New York Times)

As with last time Iâ€™m not completely sure that Iâ€™ll be able to stay awake until the very end but Iâ€™m pretty sure that Iâ€™m going to enjoy the time until itâ€™s just time for the bed ðŸ˜‰. 

So far, GoGraz hasnâ€™t yet received any invitation to participate in that event through allowing signups through our Meetup page, but perhaps thatâ€™s still coming. In any case, consider this post as my little contribution to get more people to those GDN events ðŸ˜…
