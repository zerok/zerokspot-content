Today, I finally found the couple of minutes to integrate [retoots][] into
[GoGraz.org](https://gograz.org). While doing that I came up with a couple of
things that I'd like to improve about it in the near future:

- Create an ansible-role so that you can easily install it on your server using
  [Ansible][].
- Create a simple JavaScript that you can integrate into your website. Perhaps
  I will even use Go 1.16's embedding feature for that.
- Include boosts in the `/api/v1/interactions` result.

It's not yet clear when I'll find time for all of these but at least they're
now on my roadmap ðŸ˜‰
