Over the course of the last couple of days Iâ€™ve had a lot to do with client libraries for various online services. For this post Iâ€™m just going to use the [official Go library for Slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack) but there are many others where the presented pattern should help integrating them into test setups.

## Case 1: What data is sent?

In one situation I wanted to see what kind of data would be sent to the Slack API (for the `chat.postMessage` endpoint) without actually sending data out. We had wrapped the Slack API a little bit in order to make things like building message blocks easier but I wanted to have a way to evaluate the final HTTP request body in order to compare it with what was expected according to the specs.

Sadly, I couldnâ€™t just wrap the [slack.Client struct](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/slack-go/slack#Client) into an interface and fake a [Client.PostMessage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/slack-go/slack#Client.PostMessage) method because you feed it slack.MsgOption objects that act as configurators for a private object. So thereâ€™s no easy way to just fake the message creation with just the input of PostMessage.

With the easy way off the list, there was one last idea I had: Can I somehow inject a custom HTTP Client into the Slack client and just grab the raw HTTP request data? Yes, thatâ€™s possible and this is also the point where the `http.RoundTripper` interface comes in:

	package main
	
	import (
		"net/http"
		"testing"
	
		"github.com/slack-go/slack"
		"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
	)
	
	type LoggingRoundTripper struct {
		Requests []*http.Request
	}
	
	func (rt *LoggingRoundTripper) RoundTrip(r *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
		rt.Requests = append(rt.Requests, r)
		return nil, nil
	}
	
	func TestSlackAPIPostMessage(t *testing.T) {
		lrt := &LoggingRoundTripper{
			Requests: make([]*http.Request, 0, 10),
		}
		hc := &http.Client{
			Transport: lrt,
		}
		c := slack.New("no-token", slack.OptionHTTPClient(hc))
		c.PostMessage("somechannel", slack.MsgOptionText("hello world", false))
		require.Len(t, lrt.Requests, 1)
	}
	

In this example Iâ€™ve implemented a simple RoundTripper that just adds the incoming requests to a slice which can then validated again.

# Case 2: Fake API responses

In another situation I wanted to fake the response I got from the server. What would postMessage do, for instance, if it got a 500 status code from the server? If you want to have different behaviour for different URLs, you can, for instance, combine RoundTripper with a Handler (also provided by the net/http package). This makes it possible to just use a request muxer and keep you sane ðŸ˜…

	package main
	
	import (
		"fmt"
		"net/http"
		"net/http/httptest"
		"testing"
	
		"github.com/go-chi/chi"
		"github.com/slack-go/slack"
		"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
	)
	
	type FakeServerRoundTripper struct {
		Handler http.Handler
	}
	
	func (rt *FakeServerRoundTripper) RoundTrip(r *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
		if rt.Handler == nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("no handler set")
		}
		w := httptest.NewRecorder()
		rt.Handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)
		return w.Result(), nil
	}
	
	func TestSlackAPIPostMessage(t *testing.T) {
		mux := chi.NewRouter()
		mux.Post("/api/chat.postMessage", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		})
		fsrt := &FakeServerRoundTripper{Handler: mux}
		hc := &http.Client{
			Transport: fsrt,
		}
		c := slack.New("no-token", slack.OptionHTTPClient(hc))
		_, _, err := c.PostMessage("somechannel", slack.MsgOptionText("hello world", false))
		require.Error(t, err)
		require.Contains(t, err.Error(), "500")
	}
	


## Conclusion

While I would have preferred to use fake interface implementations to test some of the interactions with the Slack API and other libraries, itâ€™s sometimes simply not possible. Luckily, most HTTP-based libraries allow you to at least inject your own `http.Client` and so you can at least fake your way around with a custom RoundTripper. It may not be nice, but itâ€™s definitely powerful!

Now I just have to restrain myself so that I donâ€™t abuse this pattern too much ðŸ˜†
