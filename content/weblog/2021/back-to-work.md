So my vacation is over ðŸ˜­ and this means back to work! It also means that I finally see some folks (virtually) again ðŸ¥³. To make things easier, I picked a coding task as my first one for 2021. I think there will never come the day when I wonâ€™t enjoy an interesting coding task, and if itâ€™s not interesting by itself, making the implementation more testable sure is!

To freshen things up a little bit Iâ€™ve also made some changes to my personal (non-work) journal! The weekly overview is now just a single page anymore while Iâ€™m currently considering making the monthly into a spread again (in order to have habit trackers there). I now also have so many different Safari/AL-Star colours (with the matching inks) that I want to have a different secondary colour every week for things like header and highlighting. Perhaps I will eventually expand this also to my work-journal, but weâ€™ll see.
