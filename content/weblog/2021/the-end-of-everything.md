Every since I was a kid watching the German translation of Carl Sagan's “Cosmos” on TV I've been fascinated with the cosmos, space, and science in general. While my actions influenced by this fascination were mostly limited to me reading and loving sci-fi literature, I've also read “A Brief History of time” by Stephen Hawking and also listened to “Astrophysics for people in a hurry” by Neil deGrasse Tyson in recent years. 

In [“The End of Everything”](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-End-of-Everything/Katie-Mack/9781982103545) Katie Mack now focuses on how the cosmos might end but not after first giving a look into how it might have started. While I enjoyed the two book by “The Hawk” and   Neil deGrasse Tyson, I enjoyed these 226 pages by Katie Mack even more!

The way she manages to explain complicated concept from the world of cosmology in simple terms and with analogies just clicked more with me. Despite a topic that should normally be depressing, she also combines it with so much enthusiasm and pure curiosity, it's hard not to grin every time a new topic is explored.

If the cosmos is also the stuff of your dreams, just do yourself a favor and read this book! (Sadly not available as eBook without DRM 😑)
