Last Friday we went into the city in order to start the weekend off properly at a restaurant. On the way to one of our favourites I also took a quick detour first to a paper store where I got most of my Leuchtturms and also to the local fountain pen store to order one of the new Leuchtturm 1917 120g notebooks and also a [Platinum Procyon Deep Sea](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2021/7/5/platinum-procyon-fountain-pen-review). The latter is going to be my very first Japanese fountain pen so Iâ€™m especially looking forward to that!

As for the 120g, I already wrote about it [last month](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/06/11/leuchtturm1917-edition-120g/).  I also finally found a pen that works well with the [black Carbon Ink from Platinum](https://mountainofink.com/blog/platinum-carbon-black) that I bought a couple of months back in the ops of having a waterproof ink: A Lamy Safari (Umbra) with a fine nib instead of an extra-fine one. While the combination works quite well, the normal Leuchtturm paper still shows some feathering and bleeding and so and I want to get rid of that. The waterproof properties of the ink given the heat we have right now (sweat, condensation on cold bottles, â€¦) turned out to be just too useful for now ðŸ˜…
