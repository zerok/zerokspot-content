Today, the Austrian government had another one of their - by now - famous press events in which they [announced](https://orf.at/stories/3203482/) that restaurants, cultural institutions and others in Vorarlberg might be finally opening up again with 2021-03-15. On the 27th restaurants with outdoor seating in other states might follow pending infection rates.

Given how recent openings have affected the infection rate in Austria over the last couple of weeks, I'm curious if that timeline will hold. I'm so waiting for a chance to finally sit in a beer garden with friends again but not at every price. Perhaps we will at least get a lot of people inoculated until May...
