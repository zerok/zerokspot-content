Ever since the discussion around the [master branch name](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/) started again in 2020, I decided I wanted to switch at least all my public, personal repositories over to using “main” as the default branch. Two weeks ago, [GitLab also announced that the would make that switch](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/10/new-git-default-branch-name/) which reminded me that I still had some work to do.

Over the last couple of days I’ve now converted pretty much everyone that I have on GitHub and GitLab over, deleting or archiving everything else. Out of what remains on there, around 30 repositories have now been converted. I might have missed a couple but I’m planning to convert them once I find them 🙃
