Exactly 12 months ago, right when the pandemic started to hit Austria and in the first weeks of my educational leave, I started replacing GTD with bullet journaling as the primary method to organise my life. Iâ€™ve already written about the actual move back then and also in my updates after [two](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/13/two-month-bulletjournaling/) and [six](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/09/13/six-months-of-bullet-journaling/) months so I will try to only write here about what has changed since then ðŸ˜€

The biggest change since September is that I no longer miss OmniFocus. It took nearly a year but now Iâ€™m finally at a point where I trust the system enough! The last missing step that pushed me over the edge was mostly me [solving my inbox problem](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/01/21/my-new-inbox/) in January by just using some small A6 booklets for that.

## Page types

Over the course of last 12 months Iâ€™ve experimented greatly with how I should structure my weekly, monthly, and daily pages. In the end (well, for now at least) Iâ€™ve settled on a simple list of days on the monthly view (one row per day) which also includes my habit trackers, an [Alastair-style weekly page](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/02/01/the-alastair-method/), and classic bujo floating daily pages. On the daily pages I keep all the operational tasks and organize the weekly pages once every week (usually on Sunday) so that I usually donâ€™t need the monthly page or the future log until the next Sunday.

Aside from classic task management Iâ€™ve also mostly moved all kind of content tracking into my journal. I now have a list of books that I want to read, TV/Netflix shows I want to watch, and even games I want to play. Previously I had at least part of that on services like Goodreads which I now only use as a mirror of those canonical lists in my journal.

## Hardware

Hardware-wise Iâ€™ve mostly use A5 hardcover notebooks during the last year. Since last March Iâ€™ve filled 2.5 (around 250 pages each) of them and also kept additional notebooks for work-topics and certification efforts.  Right now Iâ€™m using [Leuchtturm1917 notebooks](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-5-3-4-x-8-1-4-in.html) for that but Iâ€™m still experimenting. Next on the stack will be a [softcover notebook Rhodia](https://www.bloc-rhodia.com/produkt-117452c-notizbuch-softcover-a5.html), something that Iâ€™m really looking forward to but I will probably have to wait until late summer for that ðŸ˜… I can then finally use my [Roterfaden Taschenbegleiter](https://roterfaden.de/en_US/shop/product/taschenbegleiter-v-19-319?category=4) to its full potential! With this I want to split my journal up into a more permanent part and an operational part, something that will be easy once I can keep more than one booklet in the Taschenbegleiter ðŸ˜Š

Pen-wise Iâ€™m now extremely happy with the following setup:

1. [Lamy 2000](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/02/15/new-pen-day-lamy-2000/) with EF nib and black Parker ink (might be replaced with Platinum Carbon black in the future for resistance to sweaty hands)
2. [TWSBI Diamond 580 ALR](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/02/11/new-pen-day-twsbi-diamond-580alr-nickel-gray/) with gray Pelikan Moonstone ink which I use for shadowing and borders

As supporting colors I also have some [mango ink](https://www.lamyshop.com/tinte-lamy-t52.html?sel=1424) for highlighting calendar events on the daily page so that I donâ€™t miss any important calls or something like that (has happened in the past and so I added the highlighting).

## Conclusion

After a year Iâ€™m now finally at the point where I fell at home in my journal. I like the system and itâ€™s adaptability and I donâ€™t really see myself moving back to GTD or over to some other system anytime soon. On to another year ðŸ˜…
