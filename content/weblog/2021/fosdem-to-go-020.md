Yesterday morning Apple approved a little bugfix I made to [FosdemToGo](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/fosdemtogo/id1500192366?l=en), my little [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2021/) companion app for iOS. Thereâ€™s [nothing major](https://github.com/zerok/fosdem-to-go/commit/4a41189b899da7080195f61ebe1cada820f25412) in 0.2.0 but you can now also browse through the schedules that are already available for this yearâ€™s event taking place on Feb 6 and Feb 7 ðŸ˜Š

If youâ€™re on iOS and want to give it a try, you can find the app [here](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/fosdemtogo/id1500192366?l=en) ðŸ˜€ In case you want to see me learning Swift and iOS development, you can find the [source code](https://github.com/zerok/fosdem-to-go/) for this app on GitHub.
