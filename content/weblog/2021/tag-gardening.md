Right at the start of the new year [Karl Voit wrote about doing some
gardening][1] on his blog in order to trim down and update the various tags
he's using. This is something I've been pushing up for a really long time. At
the time of writing this post, my blog has more than 1,600 [tags](/tags) with
many if not most being used only once.

In order to make tags useful to me again, I've now started to normalize some
(e.g. using `books` instead of `book`) but also remove others completely that I
simply don't see any use for anymore. One example here is the tag `23` which
was for the photo sharing website 23hq. This site ... is still online but
didn't go anywhere nor have I look at or even used it since 2007.

I don't yet have a real process on how to keep tags well-maintained but perhaps
I should just do a yearly review in which I look at all the tags I have and all
the posts I have and see how well they fit together at that time. How are you
doing that?
