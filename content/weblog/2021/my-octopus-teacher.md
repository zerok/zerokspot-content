Today I watched one of the most touching documentaries Iâ€™ve seen in a while. [My Octopus Teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Octopus_Teacher) follows film-maker Craig Foster as he picks up a childhood habit of diving again and comes across an octopus. Eventually they become accustomed to each other. In daily diving sessions he comes to learn all about the life of the octopus and find his place in that ecosystem. 

The whole experience was deeply personal. In the end I just wanted to know what happened next to that cute little animal and how it did its hunting. Btw.: did you know that lobster swim backwards? ðŸ˜… There were lots of little details that were just fascinating! If you have a Netflix account, definitely give this one a try!

Something else that completely amazed me was the lung capacity of Mr Foster. I should probably get some decent snorkeling gear and work on that again...
