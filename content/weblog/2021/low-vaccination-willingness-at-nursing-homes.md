I really donâ€™t get humans. First everyone complains that the homes for elderly people have to stay locked down with only very complicated setups for visitors in order to protect those living there. Now, that we have vaccines that would allow to loosen some of these restrictions, only between 60 and 80% of the residents and 50-60% of the employees wanted it according to this news item by the [ORF](https://orf.at//stories/3198702/)â€¦

There might be absolutely valid reasons for some of these but so many? This is just crazy and I really hope that this is no indication for the rest of Austria. At least the general willingness [seems to be increasing](https://www.tt.com/artikel/30775163/anschober-impfbereitschaft-in-oesterreich-steigt-weiter) after the abysmal statistics from December but I fear weâ€™ll be in some form of lockdown all the way until summer and some families will probably have to live without seeing elderly family members again until then given the vaccination ratio there ðŸ˜ž
