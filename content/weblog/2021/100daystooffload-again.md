Mike wrote a couple of days ago that [heâ€™d once again to a 100DaysToOffload](https://mikestone.me/a-new-year-and-a-new-challenge) on his blog. Since I also have now written something every day since the new year has started, I might as well also join him!

At this point Iâ€™m not sure if I will stick to the original rules of the challenge, publishing one post every single day for the next 100 days, or if I will simply write 100 blog posts over the course of the year. What I know for sure, though, is that Iâ€™ll have to update the [tagâ€™s page on my blog](https://zerokspot.com/tags/100daystooffload/) in order to show my progress for this year ðŸ™ƒ

In any case, [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev/105530567822163391), [Hyde](https://lazybear.social/@hyde/105530450026501568), and others might also be participating once again and looking through the history of the [\#100DaysToOffload tag on Mastodon](https://chaos.social/tags/100DaysToOffload) I see lots of new faces, so it definitely wonâ€™t be just the two of us ðŸ˜…

That reminds me, I definitely need to convince a certain someone whoâ€™s recently posted quite a lot on Instagram, that having that content on a personal blog might be more future-proof ðŸ¤ª
