Yesterday, Nintendo hat once again one of their [Nintendo Direct!](https://youtu.be/IH7QtiX1I7Y) presentations in which they showed what will be coming up during the rest of the year and 2022. Letâ€™s say it this way: I wonâ€™t get bored in the next 18 months ðŸ˜‰

Those are pretty much my highlights:

- [Metroid Dread](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/metroid-dread-brings-nintendos-classic-back-as-a-2d-sequel-on-october-8/): I loved Super Metroid and also enjoyed the Prime series although I never extensively played those games. I simply didnâ€™t have the time back then and then kind of forgot about them. But especially since Dead Cell, Axiom Verge, and Shadow Company I grew to love a good Metroidvania and ... well, this just looks awesome and I cannot wait to get my hands on it!
- [Advance Wars 1+2: Re-boot camp](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021) is a remastering of Advance Wars 1 and 2 with new graphic style. Especially the first game is among my all-time favorites and Iâ€™m looking forward to playing it but also its successor again on a larger screen.

OK, but what about in the really near future? Next week, [Mario Golf: Super Rush](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-golf-super-rush-switch/) is being released and Iâ€™m pretty sure it will be more than just a little entertaining. Given my current stress level this might be just what I need in order to switch off in the evenings. I will most likely spent the most time in the classic mode (well, golf, ...) and the adventure mode but letâ€™s see. Perhaps the the more competitive and fast-paced multiplayer modes might also be something for ... the future ðŸ˜…

Do you have a Nintendo Switch? What are you looking forward to after yesterdayâ€™s announcements?
