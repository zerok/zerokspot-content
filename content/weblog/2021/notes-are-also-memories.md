Notes are also posts, just short ones. I mostly have this blog to build up a [memex](https://dri.es/building-a-personal-memex)of public thoughts and solutions so that I can look back at what was interesting to me in the past and have something to link to if asked a question.

For the longest time and also for 100DaysToOffload I've treated notes like as if they were second-class content. But for the whole memory aspect size doesn't really matter. And for this reason I'll now finally stop feeling bad if I don't manage to write a full weblog post every day and accept that sometimes a collection of links and brief notes is more than enough!
