I wanted to up my skills regarding pair-programming while accidentally stumbling about [“Practical pair programming”](https://abookapart.com/products/practical-pair-programming) in the A Book Apart catalog. This one won’t teach you the basics but instead focuses provide you with some tips and tricks for first getting the practice established and then improving your own behaviour to become a better pairing partner. And all that in a very concise way without all that much fluff around it.

Personally, I would have liked the book to also include a basics section and also some practical examples of how various people have set up their routine, offline and online. There *are* some suggestions for tooling but at least for me complete examples would have been better. As it is right now, I see this book more as an extension to other books but I’m not sure if it’s worth it getting it all by itself.
