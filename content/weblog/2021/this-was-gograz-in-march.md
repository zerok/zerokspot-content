Last night we once again had our [monthly Go meetup](https://gograz.org/meetup/2021-03-15/) for the local community in Graz! Same as in February we also had a presentation thanks to [Christoph](https://tux21b.org/) who gave us a little tour of [Gio](https://gioui.org/), a toolkit for Go which allows for a very low-level yet convenient way to create GUI applications on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and even iOS. Oh, and you can even compile the applications into WebAssembly!

Afterwards we had a bit of a discussion in which Matthias dropped the following two libraries for further consideration:

- [segmentio/ksuid](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid) as an alternative to various UUID variants
- [shopspring/decimal](https://github.com/shopspring/decimal) for working with fixed-point decimal numbers (and monetary values in particular)

Big thanks once again to everyone who came (and Christoph in particular for giving a talk!)! It was a blast!
