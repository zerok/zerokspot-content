Today was the second and last day of [FOSDEM 2021](https://fosdem.org/2021/) on which I, once again, spent a bit of time in the community track but also joined the Tool The Docs folks for some talks:

- [Some SQL Tricks of an Application DBA](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/postgresql_some_sql_tricks_of_an_application_dba/)
- [Getting Started with Grafana Tempo](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/getting_started_tempo/)
- [Proper Monitoring](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/dev_practice_monitoring/)
- [Making Documentation a First-class Citizen in Open Source Projects](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_documentation_first_class_citizen/)
- [Mental health and free software](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_mental_health_free_software/)
- [Online Conferences and the "new normal".](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_online_converences_newnormal/)
- [Creating a documentation site for users with AsciiDoc and Antora](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ttdasciidocantora/)
- [20 years with DocBook](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ttdpostgresdocbook/)
- [Closing FOSDEM 2021](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/closing_fosdem/)

I learnt again a lot but the emotional highlight was probably when [Jason Yee](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/dev_practice_monitoring/) did his talk in the parks and roofs of Portland.

If we were in Brussels we would now get into a nice restaurant for some last beer rounds and tomorrow do some last minute shopping at Uniqlo and Neuhaus for some (ok, a lot) Belgium chocolate before boarding our plane back to Graz. 

While I won't have any chocolate this time, unlike last year I ordered [a shirt and a hoodie](https://fosdem.org/2021/tshirts/) ðŸ˜¬ Make sure to get years before next Sunday ðŸ™‚
