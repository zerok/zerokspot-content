So, [Matthew Inman](https://theoatmeal.com/) has a new game out and itâ€™s called [Kitty Letter](https://theoatmeal.com/blog/free_game). If youâ€™ve played Clash Royale before and are into word-puzzles, this one is for you. I have dumped quite a bit of time into [Dear Reader](https://www.dearreadergame.com/) (a word-game on Apple Arcade) and immediate fell for it.

Just as in Clash Royale youâ€™re fighting a single enemy that can (same as you) send kittens on their way to explode into your house (yes, there are lots of references to [Exploding Kittens](https://explodingkittens.com/) in here). In order to send them out, you have to spell words from a selection of letters. Kittens that march in same lane as your enemiesâ€™, they will neutralise each other, otherwise theyâ€™ll hit their target.

While that alone sounds found, there are a lot of modifiers and additional tools that you can use to, for instance, vacuum all the kittens in a lane or cut the attacking force in half. So far, the story mode has been great fun! I wasnâ€™t yet brave enough to play it against some stranger online but perhaps I will at least play it against some friends in the future ðŸ˜… In the meantime, the story mode and the arcade mode (basically wave after wave of kittens).

It might not be a game that you will play for months and months but I can definitely see myself picking it up every now and then. If I can convince some other folks to play it against me then it might have even more longevity.

Technically, it looks extremely simplistic with the art-style youâ€™d expect from The Oatmeal. Sadly, there are some slowdowns after a lot of rounds but nothing Iâ€™d consider a show-stopper. The game also adds a lot of variety thanks to the modifiers and action items so depending on your opponent it can be a really tough challenge!

Itâ€™s available for iOS and Android and is free. If you still want to give something back, there are some cosmetic in-app purchases like avatars etc.. Since I had enough fun already, I went for a little bundle that would give me the tacocat as avatar ðŸ˜‰
