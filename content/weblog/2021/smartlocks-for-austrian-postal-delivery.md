According to [this article on "Der Standard"][ds] the [Austrian postal
service][oepag] ("Österreichische Post AG" or ÖPAG for short) is working in
cooperation with [Nuki][n] (a local company specialized in such systems) on
offering delivery of packages directly into your home if you're not there.

The idea here is that you attach an electronic lock to your normal front-door
lock. When something should be delivered to you, the delivery person rings the
bell as usual. If nobody answers, they can unlock the door and put the package
on a special delivery mat.

Optionally, you will also be able to connect a special surveillance camera to
the whole setup which should prevent abuse.

Back in [2017 Amazon announced][a2017] their Key service which should do pretty
much the same. Two years later they basically had to cancel that service due to
various concerns according to [The Verge][a2019] and moved over to only
delivering to your garage.

I don't think that ÖPAG will do much better here. Why you would give a delivery
person access to your home is beyond me. There are just so many aspects of that
idea that make me kringe. Who is responsible that the camera only records if
the door has been opened by the delivery service? Where are the recordings
stored?  Are there recordings? Are they admissible at a court if lock is
abused? The camera is provided by the ISP A1, what if you are with some other
ISP? What if I already have a Nuki lock? And these are just the questions I
could come up in the first couple of minute.

While I personally think that the Austrian postal service is still the most
reliable option where I live and I really like our delivery people here, I've
had quite a few delivery issues in the past and also the organisation and
customer service of ÖPAG is far from working flawlessly.

I would only give my very best friends a key to my apartment with the explicit
agreement that they can only use it if I explicitly ask them to&#x2026; A
delivery service doesn't came even remotely close to qualifying for the same
level of trust.
