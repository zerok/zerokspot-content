title: 'Kumite on the go with Tekken: Dark Resurrection'
---


I was just watching [The 1up Show](http://the1upshow.1up.com/) from last week and they said something that made me really consider "Tekken: Dark Resurrection" for the PSP: It has a mode comparable to the Kumite mode in Virtua Fighter 4. For those of you who don't know this mode: Think about it as a basically endless sequence of challenges were you fight against opponents of various skill levels and you can also increase your own skill level to earn the right to fight against better and better opponents.

Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution probably maxed it out by putting this whole idea into some kind of simulation of various arcades within a city. First your fight a few rounds against the players there, earn a higher kyu/dan grade on your way up and finally fight everyone again in a small arcade tournament to earn the right to go to other arcades out there. If I remember correctly there might have been something similiar in Tekken 5 for the PS2, but a mode like this would even be more useful on the go.

-------------------------------



I don't know how exactly TDR is doing it now, but also a kumite mode comparable to what VF4 (not VF4Evo) had, would probably warrant the purchase of this game for me considering that I probably spent quite some time in that mode alone in VF4 back in the days.

According to the [review on IGN](http://psp.ign.com/articles/719/719836p1.html) it is also possible to share ghosts so you might also be able to fight people from all around the world while not being currently online :D (similiar to what Sega actually did IIRC to create the arcade fighters in VF4Evo)

Well, but is it really worth the nearly 50EUR if you already have Tekken 5 for the PS2? That's exactly my problem now, but I guess I will have figured that out when the game is released in Europe in a little over a month. But I guess ... Field Commander comes first ... in less than a week to be precise :)
