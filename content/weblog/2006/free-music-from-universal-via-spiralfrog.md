title: Free music from Universal via SpiralFrog?
---


Seems like at least some music companies are thinking about new delivery methods. So happened with Universal Music which according to [various](http://www.aurum3.com/newtech/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=177&Itemid=18) [news](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060829/tc_nm/spiralfrog_dc) [sites](http://webtwitcher.newsvine.com/_news/2006/08/30/344918-spiralfrog-puts-music-downloads-in-price-freefall) out there are going to offer in cooperation with SpiralFrog.com free music downloads while showing you ads during the download process. The Guardian has a [very detailed article](http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1860928,00.html) about this new offer which will launch this year in the US and somewhen next year also in Europe. 

-------------------------------



The whole idea has one big catch, though: Yet another new format which according to the Guardian article won't be compatible with Apple's iPod or any other current MP3-compatible player. Conclusion? Great idea, typical bad implementation ... at least if there is no alternative which will also play on those players with the big market share.
