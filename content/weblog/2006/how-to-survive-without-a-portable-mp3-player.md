title: How to survive without a portable MP3-player?
---


Well, an option would be, to try it without music and podcasts until the new player has arrived. But since this would be quite a pain for me I thought I should give the PSP a try for this since it even comes with a small remote controll for exactly this purpose. 

-------------------------------



So after uploading some podcasts comes the first annoyance: It seems like you can't switch the PSP completely on and off using the remote controll, but at least you can get it back from stand-by with it.



One warning here: Never (and I mean NEVER) have your earbuds in your ears when switching the PSP on. This really has to be damaging the ears :-?



Tomorrow will the first of hopefully just 4 days with this setup, but I guess I will have to write something about it when I come home tomorrow ;)
