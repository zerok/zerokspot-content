title: Metal Gear ACID! == Black hole for free time
---


It's been rather quiet here for the last couple of days and I have to disappoint you: I have _not_ done anything really useful to save mankind or things like that. All I did was play [Metal Gear ACID!](http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mga/english/) basically all the time since I had the last exam for this semester. Damn, I even have a MGA wallpaper now as my desktop's background image ... Anyway, there were definitely some things planed for this weekend before I started playing ACID:

-------------------------------



* Getting around the problems technorati seems to have with indexing my books blog

* Finally messing around a little bit with Ruby on Rails and AJAX.

* Adding tags to the books blog

* ... watching some olympic competitions, although, I at least tried it in combination with playing ACID ;)



Other things I want to write before getting some sleep:



* Too bad, there is still now new [DL.tv](http://dl.tv) episode online :-( The stream was on Thursday but now H.264 file seems to have left the encoding cluster...

* Why can't I get the uncut version of the new Korn album "See you on the other side" in the Austrian iTunes store :-(
