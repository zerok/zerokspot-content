title: Ma.gnolia out for today?

Ma.gnolia since a few hours is in my opinion one of the best examples for when global error handling just sucks ;)

"contact us" is a link that should actually point to a contact form, email address or something similiar. Just too bad, that this page is also basically killed by the same error message, so you can't get to that form or email address ;) 



I really hope, that the problems over there are fixed soon, otherwise I will probably forget about all those sites I wanted to bookmark :-(
