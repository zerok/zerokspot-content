title: Apple exchanged iBook/PowerBook batteries
---


Seems like Dell wasn't Sony's only customer. Yesterday Apple too started an [exchange program](https://support.apple.com/ibook_powerbook/batteryexchange) for batteries sold between October 2003 and August 2006 ... and guess who has one of the affected batteries :-? 

After noticing this yesterday night thanks to [this article on Golem](http://www.golem.de/0608/47375.html) I went right away to order a replacement, but somehow the form didn't accept my battery's serial number. Well, seems like the server had just too much load because now it finally seems to work :-) Let's see, how long it will take Apple this time to ship the new battery.
