Good things can take [some time](http://textpattern.com/weblog/171/ask-a-dev-when-will-xml-rpc-show-up). [Now](http://textpattern.com/weblog/201/xml-rpc-support-for-textpattern-403-is-here) Textpattern also has an XML-RPC interface [implementing](http://txp.kusor.com/rpc-api) the BloggerAPI and the metaWeblogAPI completely and the MovableType API partially. According to the [documentation of the MovableType API implementation](http://txp.kusor.com/rpc-api/movabletype-xml-rpc-api) it even supports the keywords field :)

Now the folks out there who prefer to use a desktop tool for everything, finally can also use TXP as their blogging engine ;)



That somehow reminds me that I wanted to write a small tool that would allow me to blog out of TextMate ... but first I should perhaps move back to categories again to having to rewrite the XML-RPC API of WordPress ;)
