title: My Nintendo Wii launch bundle
---


* European bundle (+ Wii Sports)

-------------------------------

* 2nd controller (Wiimote + Nunchuk)

* 1 classic controller

* The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

* Excite Truck (if it's really a launch title)

* Wing Island



Both, Wing Island and Excite Truck, can only drop out of this list, if they get review scores below 7.0 on IGN/GameSpot/1up ;)



Now I'm really curious what games will be available on day one in the Virtual Console.
