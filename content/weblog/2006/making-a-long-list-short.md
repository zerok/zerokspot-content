title: Making a long list short
---


I started this blog somewhen in November 2003 basically as a frontpage for my phpBB installation. Many months have come since then and I think there were only 3 of them that haven't seen a post here. So the list in the sidebar grew longer and longer and soon things like my recent flickr photos and my blogroll were only visible after hours of scrolling ;) 

-------------------------------



Tonight (after finishing learning for an exam tomorrow) I implement a JS/DOM solution for this problem. This way the archives stay accessible for people without JS/DOM enabled. I hope you like it :) And if you find any problems with this solution, please let me know :)
