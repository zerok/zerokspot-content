Sometimes when you compare Django with other (perhaps) more popular frameworks like RoR you hear people saying, that there is too little literature esp. in the form of books out there for the Python web framework. 

This seems now about to change. Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss have [started](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2006/oct/31/book/) opening up their upcoming book about Django to the community under [djangobook.com](http://www.djangobook.com/). 

From what it looks like, they will release 2 chapters every week and are requesting comments, suggestions etc. to improve the book for the planed "physical" release in 2007.

The whole commenting looks absolutely great. Comments can be posted alongside the text and will appear as small speech-bubbles on the left side of the page. 

Now I'm just curious how this will turn out in the end, esp. if this will be more than what the official tutorial pages currently have to offer.
