title: Writely send invitations and Google Analytics goes public
---


Seems like a big release day for Google. First they announced, that [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) is now open to the public (so no invitation required anymore) and this morning I then receive a mail from [Writely](http://www.writely.com/) saying, that I can now finally get an account there :D Writely still seems to be invite only, but at least it appears that they are finally giving them out again ;-)

I guess I will now finally give Google Analytics a try and see how it hold up against Performancing Metrics. I still think it's strange, though, that Google has set some limitations for the free Analytics accounts ...

I doubt that I will get near that value in the forseeable future, but hey if anyone out there could live without using a policy like this, it would be Google, right?
