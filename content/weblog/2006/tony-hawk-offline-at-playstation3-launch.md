title: Tony Hawk offline at Playstation3 launch
---


Is it just me or is Sony really preparing a big disaster for their PS3 launch in Japan and the USA this November? Today [GamesIndustry.biz](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=19756) and [Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=67694) reported (quoting [IGN](http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/732/732680p1.html)), that the PS3 version of _Tony Hawk's Project 8_ (which is slated as a launch title for the blue diode sucker) will not include an online component because they still haven't received all required libs and no details about the online components of the PS3. I guess, who wants to do some Skateboard magic online will have to do this on Xbox Live then.

Uhm... the Playstation3 is scheduled to have its launch in ... 2 months. And there are still no final devkits out there? Also the beta devkits still seem to be quite new:

<blockquote>
	<p>Only within the last three weeks has Neversoft received its PS3 beta kits [...] Neversoft is confident the PS3 version of the game will ship at launch in November, but it still hasn't received all of the software libraries and has no indication of how the online components will work on PS3, so it's not offering them.</p>

</blockquote>

Note that this article was published last Thursday. Sounds like a developer's nightmare.

Well, for those people who want to get a PS3 right at launch in the USA or Japan it could at least become a quite ... lonely launch without online functionality in launch titles. Let's see if things could get worse.
