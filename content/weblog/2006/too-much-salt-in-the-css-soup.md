title: Too much salt in the CSS soup
---


One of the funniest things I've ever seen: On Malarkey there was just a few days ago a small [game of CSS](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/too_many_cooks_dvorak_special.html) (to convince John C. Dvorak of the power of CSS) were the author simply tells, what HTML elements can be styled within a stylesheet and then leaves it to commenters to come up with the actual definitions. An additional rule was that there was _only one_ stylesheet, so each comment has to be based on the previous ones.

Okay, [the](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/way_too_many_cooks_dvorak_special.html) [result](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/examples/toomanycooks_dvorakspecial.html) looks more like "Let's shoot the squirrel", but I still like the idea :)
