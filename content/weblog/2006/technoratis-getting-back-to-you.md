title: Technorati's getting back to you ...
---


Something new from the Technorati front. This time there is a new newsletter called the "Technorati Buzz Monitor" which appears like a lightweight version of the Rojo newsletter on the news side but it also offers some hints on how to use Technorati. Nice. A little minimal on the news side, but nice :-)

The other new "feature" of Technorati is a (week-) [daily video show](http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/10/129.html) presenting some of the hot topics of the day in a humorous way. Nothing new, but nice :-)

So to some things up: Nice

Just one small request about the video show: Could you please provide an RSS with the show as QuickTime or something like that?

 Am not really a big fan of non-collectable flash content ;-)
