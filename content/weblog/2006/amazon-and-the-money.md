<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/amazon_waehrung.1.png" alt="New currency on Amazon.de" class="left"/> Seems like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/284266/ref=topnav__w/303-7000584-6739411) is fed up with the whole international currency situation and has decided to create one of its own. Although, a name would have been nice. 205,72 what?

It's also nice to see, that this value is just an approximation ;)
