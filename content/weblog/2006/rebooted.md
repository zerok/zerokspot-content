<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/logo.jpg" alt="" class="left"/>First of all I want to apologize. This wasn't really planed and this design basically happened yesterday and the night before yesterday. But more about this later.

First of all, what is new:

* Well, as you can see zerokspot.com has become quite dark. I was heavily inspired by various sites include [discoapp.com](http://discoapp.com) to finally try a dark/near-black design.
* The sidebar is now basically optional and can be toggled using the "Sidebar" link in the menubar. This only works (and the links only appears) when you JavaScript enabled.

-------------------------------


* Simpler: The whole markup is way simpler constructed compared to v3. The main motivation behind this was, that I also want to use this design for other subpages of zerokspot and want to spare me some pain of porting an over-complicated markup structure to a different and probably less flexible application than Drupal.
* jQuery: All the custom JavaScript is now done using the fabulous [jQuery](http://jquery.com) framework. There might be some bugs here and there esp. when it comes to some compatibility issues with the JavaScripts used by Drupal, but I guess this will all go away when Drupal 5.0 finally lands :)
* On every page the visitor will see right away, that this site is a personal website. While this might be the über-feature, when browsing the web knowing right away who was behind a page became very important to me. In the future I also want to add the hCard microformat in this little box.

OK, that's for the new part. Now to the part where I explain how this happened:

I read an article on [37signals.com](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/90-design-decisions-backpack-page-blank-slate) and loved on of the screenshots in it. So the first version of this design was still with a white background. Then on Monday afternoon I added the hidable menubar. I think I also bought a Disco license on that day and visited [discoapp.com](http://discoapp.com) quite a lot during that time. This seems to have influenced me enough to change some parameters in the stylesheet and voilà, there was the black design. 

Again, this happened all after I had written [that I won't participate in this Reboot](http://zerokspot.com/node/778). Back then the design draft looked totally different ;-)

Anyway, I hope you like it :)
