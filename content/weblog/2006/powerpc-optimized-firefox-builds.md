title: PowerPC optimized Firefox builds
---


<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/firefoxmac.png" alt="" class="left"/>Being a browser jumper it normally only takes a really small reason for switching browsers again after having used one for some time without any problems. So it happened somewhen last week, that I once again went from Firefox to Safari. And the reason? Performance. 



-------------------------------



But just after a few days I began to miss all those nice little extensions that make web development that much more convenient with Firefox (Firebug, etc.). So I began googling for PowerPC optimized builds of Firefox. Last december I found [this page](http://www.beatnikpad.com/archives/2005/12/01/firefox15) where Neil Lee posted his builds, but somehow I couldn't find this page this time \*g\*. Probably just blind ;) 

This time I found ... daily builds on Adam Michel's [Furbism.com](http://firefoxmac.furbism.com/). Now performance is less a problem and with this cute icon it's even harder to stop using the panda ;)
