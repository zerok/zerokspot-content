title: Let the Ratchet & Clank weekend begin :D
---


Yesterday I got Ratchet &amp; Clank 2 and Ratchet: Gladiator and I really love R&amp;C2 so far. It's just like the first game but with better graphics, upgradable weapons and more.

There's just one little thing, that annoys the hell out of me: Remember those info screens that appear in some kind of tutorial fashion to introduce you to special button combos and so on? Well, they now seem to appear whenever you reach a certain location when first playing a level through. No matter if you've been there before or not. Not really a big thing, but still annoying in my opinion esp. since this behaviour seems to be new in R&amp;C2. At least, I can't remember noticing it in the first game of the series.

-------------------------------



At least those messages only appear during the first couple of hours ;) The rest of the game has been really great so far. Still the good old Ratchet &amp; Clank humor. Just a little bit more of Capt. Quark would have been nice, though ;-)
