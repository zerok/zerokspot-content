title: No MovableType API documentation?
---


Is it just me or has sixapart really removed the API documentation from their server(s)? At least [the previous URL](http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual\_programmatic.html) guides you now only to the user manual (for MT 3.2) ... or do they have dropped their own API altogether? It's not even linked anymore in their [Advanced topic about integrating remote systems](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/3.2/11_advanced_topics/#entry-5345), not to mention that the link, which should lead to some further information about the API support in MT seems to have suffered from some TODO-list-management-issues ;)

-------------------------------



Have they perhaps dropped their own API in favour of the new <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-07.txt">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>? Anyway, just removing all the old documentation is a little bit harsh to me, but as long as there's [more than a copy on archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20050204004812/http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html) I don't really mind ;)
