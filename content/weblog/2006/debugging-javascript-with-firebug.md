title: Debugging JavaScript with Firebug
---


Seems like [Firebug](http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/) is more any more becoming one of the most powerful webdevelopment extensions for Firefox. Justin Palmer wrote an [in-depth report](http://encytemedia.com/blog/articles/2006/05/12/an-in-depth-look-at-the-future-of-javascript-debugging-with-firebug) about some of the new features Firebug will have in it's next release. According to this article there will be breakpoints, logging, tracing etc. facilities to make debugging JavaScripts much easier. Finally now alerts anymore ;)

-------------------------------



Now I just hope, that Joe Hewitt will release this new version reeeaally soon :D



**Update:** Sorry, it took some time finding the page again where I found the link to this article, but [here](http://pragmatically.net/articles/2006/05/14/debugging-javascript-with-firebug) it is now :)
