title: Goodies for LocoRoco demo gamers
---


IGN just [reported](http://psp.ign.com/articles/721/721064p1.html), that when you finish version 1.01 of the LocoRoco demo, you will now get a password to access some special content on the PlayStation site probably as some kind of thank you... Ey, I have that game, and I also want to have these goodies :) Now I'm just curious if you also get something like that, when finishing the actual game.

... although I have a feeling, that I will hate LocoRoco when I've finished it. So I guess, I won't by interested in a wallpapers or something like that by then.
