title: Now again with photos
---


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/286173950/" title="Photo Sharing"><img class="figure" src="http://static.flickr.com/109/286173950_0592252988_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="DSC_0727" /></a>

Quite some time ago I used images such as this as the banner for zeroKspot. Well, actually not really like this one since they all that that snow/ice/cold theme. With this redesign of zeroKspot I want to return to this habit and put some of my photos up here once again and where possible give them some seasonal style :-)

__About this picture:__ I took this one yesterday (Halloween) right before riding home from the University.

-------------------------------

 It shows the southern building of the University of Klagenfurt were part of the administration and most of the computer science institutes are located. Just too bad, that I failed in reducing the noise ... perhaps next time :)
