title: Gaming meets Web2.0
---


... no, not gaming but more game reviews, but this title definitely sounds better ;) [gibbity](http://www.gibbity.com) seems to be quite new (first post on the developers blog about it was somewhen in January) and appears with its ~200 members still quite small, but the idea at least is nice :) Not really innovative considering that every major gaming and shopping site has a way to review games. Also there are already at least another big web2.0 product review platform out there ([Riffs](http://riffs.com)) which doesn't focuses exclusively on games, but anyway.
