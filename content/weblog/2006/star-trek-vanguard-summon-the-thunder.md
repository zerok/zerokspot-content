title: 'Star Trek: Vanguard - Summon the Thunder'
---


Another book of the Star Trek: Vanguard series finished :D "Summon the Thunder" is the second book after Harbinger and also continues only a few months after the end of the first book of the series and also integrates the Romulans into the story line.


-------------------------------


Compared to David Mack's writing style which was very much straight to the point and quite action oriented, Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore seem to prefer a more slow-paced style which helps explaining the morally conflicts Commodore Reyes has to live with. The reader also finally learn more about the quite mysterious Commander T'Prynn and her inner daemons.

In general the whole sector seems also to become more vivid now that you get to know some of the stuff the Klingons are up to. You also learn some new things about that mysterious alien species introduced on the last couple of pages of the first book as well as the Romulans ;-) 

I always still have to wonder though, how this whole Tholian stuff works ... I mean: Am I the only one who thought back in the days in the TOS episode "The Tholian Web", that this was somehow the first time, they met with Tholians? Sure, this was changed later (at least partially) but that Enterprise episode in the mirror universe but anyway ...

The more VAN books I read, the more I think, we will see the beginning of the war with the Klingons here. In combination with the new Enterprise books, this could really fill some blank spots in the StarTrek timeline :-) 

To wrap this up: Good book, not as good as the first one.
