**WordPress** is now available in version [2.0.3](http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/) fixing some bugs and with some tuning under the hood. The update also includes some security related backports from the 2.1 branch.

Well, and there is finally **Ubuntu Linux 6.06** which is the first release with LTS (Long Term Support) which should esp. please corporate customers. For more information you should read the [press release](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/606released) which also announces a [book](http://www.prenhallprofessional.com/ubuntu) about Ubuntu. Looks actually quite interesting ;)
