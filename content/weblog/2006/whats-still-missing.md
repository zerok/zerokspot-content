title: What's still missing
---


While watching "Ghost Ship" yesterday I was at least able to fix my small problem with Drupal's search module, which should now finally work :) So now to the plans for the next couple of days:

* Today I ported all the book reviews from my [booksblog](http://booksblog.zerokspot.com), so only the blog posts over there are still missing.
* The return of my friends list which will be using del.icio.us this time since I'm not really motivated to write a links module (or even look for one) for Drupal and del.icio.us has all of my bookmarks anyway-
* CoComment integration. There has to be a way

-------------------------------


* And perhaps a way to get the smilies back.

I guess, this should do it for now.
