Ok, here's the promised export for NewsFire ;) First of all, you'll need [Patrick May's plist parser](http://www.narf-lib.org/2006/01/plistxml-parser-for-ruby.html) for Ruby which has to be somewhere in your $RUBYLIB. For details on how to install and use the script and its requirements, please read the README.markdown I've bundled with the script :)

-------------------------------



I've tested the whole thing and at least for me it works. If you have any problems or find any bugs in this version please comment to this post instead of mailing me :)
