[Opera](http://www.opera.com) Software [just released](http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/show.dml/631951) version 9.10 of their Qt-based browser suite. The major new feature in this release seems to be some kind of [fraud detection](http://help.opera.com/Mac/9.10/en/fraudprotection.html) system which appears to make an assynchronous check of the URL of a website against a central blacklist and shows a big red icon when you visit a page that is known to be for example a phishing pond.



-------------------------------



I guess there are also a bunch of bugfixes since the Desktop team was blogging quite a lot recently and the steady flow of weekly snapshots always held something new :-) But since there is currently no [official changelog](http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/) for this release available, you will have to browse the [Desktop Team](http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/)'s weblog for further details for now :-)
