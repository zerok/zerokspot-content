title: Charmed DVD releases messed up
---


Ok, I think this is the moment when I have to say: "I don't understand the world anymore." Today I wanted to see, what season of the Charmed TV-show are

-------------------------------

available on amazon and found something quite astonishing:



On amazon.com you get everything up to the 5th season. The [6th](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG4Y6O/) will be released somewhen in October. The funny thing is, I saw the [first box](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000ECWYSU/) of this season (yeah, the german localization is released in 2 boxes for more than twice the price) in a local store last week. I then went to amazon.de and even found the [7th season](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000FDFD7C) there for preordering for the July 27 ... Has Paramount now completely gone nuts? It's not like the german packages wouldn't include the english original ;)



Taking a look at the [release schedule on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmed_broadcasters_and_DVD_releases#Release_dates) all I can say: "Someone really messed this up..."
