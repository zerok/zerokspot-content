title: NX Personal Server no longer free :-(
---


Today I wanted to log into my server graphically once again and somehow my NX installation didn't work anymore. Sincee I know myself a little bit I'm quite sure, that I simply messed some things up again. No big problem, simply re-emerging the nx server package should get the job done. 

-------------------------------

But then I saw this:

<blockquote><pre>
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "nxserver-personal" have been masked.
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
- net-misc/nxserver-personal-1.4.0-r3 (masked by: package.mask)
# Stuart Herbert <stuart@gentoo.org> (05 Mar 2006)
# Upstream have pulled the binaries
</pre></blockquote>

"have pulled the binaries"??? My next stop was the [nomachine homepage](http://www.nomachine.com) where you get all this nice nx stuff ;) Well, where's the problem?! Everything is still in the downloads section.

But then a word caught my eye: "Evaluation". Evaluation for a free product? Strange. Then I went to the products page and found a [price list](http://www.nomachine.com/products_available.php) telling me, that nomachine now wants 84.50EUR for the personal server which I can only use for one user :-( Well, since this license is way over my head (or actually my purse) I will simply have to go back to [VNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC). Not fast, but it's free and it works. 

And to the folks over there at nomachine: Thanks for the nice time and please remove that "Get your free NX client &amp; server" image from your site, thanks.
