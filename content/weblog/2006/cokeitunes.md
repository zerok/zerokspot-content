According to [futurezone](http://futurezone.orf.at/it/stories/126819/) Apple and CocaCola have now joined forces and will open a new music store based on iTunes on August 9. What I don't understand here is the "why". Will Cokemusic offer different songs? Will I get a free coke for every 4th song I buy there? Or is this just a different frontend for iTunes with some Coke branding?

Well, at least it's another chance to get free music ... would at least be something new for me since iTunes doesn't give away stuff in Austria. Now I'm really curious what will be [there](http://www.music.coca-cola.com/) on the 9th.
