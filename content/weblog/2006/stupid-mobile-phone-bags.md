title: Stupid mobile phone bags

<a href="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/se_handybag.jpg" class="left thickbox" title="SonyEricsson mobile phone bag"><img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/se_handybag-thumb.jpg" alt="SonyEricsson Handybag"/></a>Sometimes I really wonder, if companies shouldn't simply use me as some kind of product scout for crap. For example: When I switched my mobile phone provider a week ago and got my new Sony Ericsson K608i for 3EUR, I decided to at least get a small bag for it. 

This Monday I then went to another store and finally found a bag for this mobile phone for 16.90EUR. Not all that bad and the bag looked quite solid from the outside, so I bought it. 

-------------------------------



But right after opening the package for the first time I started to get a little bit nervous. As you can see on the photo the belt strap is actually fixed only with two buttons ... So "fixed" is probably really the wrong word. A suspicion which came true right when I needed the bag for the first time. When I got off my bike the next morning, the mobile phone was sailing through the air and hitting the ground ... now that's what I bought a belt bag for.

I actually can't really think of _any_ situation when you would want to take of that strap. Do you? At least this is a good example for a bad design decision outside of IT ;-)
