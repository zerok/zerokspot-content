title: ACID2 smiles on Opera
---


Seems like the developers over their in the cold north have done it :D The [weekly build for this week](http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/show.dml/172375) seems to pass the [ACID2 test](http://www.webstandards.org/act/acid2/test.html). Congratulations :D

-------------------------------



With every new build seeing the light of the internet I can barely wait to see what the final version of Opera9 will accomplish. For starters hopefullly a big drain from the IE userbase :P
