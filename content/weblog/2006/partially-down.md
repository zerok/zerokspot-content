If you're reading this, you've probably accessed my weblog directly through [weblog.zerokspot.com](http://weblog.zerokspot.com), which still works. Thanks to some maintainance the server that is hosting zerokspot.com is currently unavailable and will be hopefully back online somewhen tomorrow morning (GMT+1). In the meantime I've set a domain redirect for zerokspot.com to point to weblog.zerokspot.com so that you don't get one of these nasty time-out screens. It will take some time for the DNS server out there to pick that up so I apologize for any problems you might have in the meantime.

-------------------------------



The other problem is the time when the server will get back online again and the domain is still redirecting here. So for now and also for the timespan that is required for the DNS servers out there to pick the change up again most of the uploaded images here as well as things like other downloadable content will be unavailable. Sorry for that :-(
