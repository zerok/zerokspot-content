title: Introducing my BooksBlog
---


As I've indicated in some other posts, I intended to split the content a little bit to keep this weblog more focused on tech and development related topics. For this reason I've now created a new weblog focused on books where I've already put everything book-related that I've posted here.

-------------------------------



BooksBlog is also my first weblog using Textpattern as engine so this will be the other experiment here ;) For example I still don't quite understand how that permlink tag works and so on, but things I will definitely find out over the time.

I also claimed the blog right away but probably thanks to some problems with the nameserver infrastructure the new subdomain took some time to get propagated though the web with all its oddities related to DNS problems ;)
