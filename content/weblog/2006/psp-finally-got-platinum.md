title: PSP finally got Platinum
---


Sony released the PSP in Europe last September and since then many gamers moaned quite a bit about the quite high price for games compared to home console or PC games. Well, the price for new games hasn't dropped or something like that, but according to Austrian retailer [Gameware.at](http://www2.gameware.at/info/space/2006-07-21-wertvoller-als-gold) there seems to be now at least also a Platinum series for PSP games :D

<blockquote><ul>
<li>F1 2005 Grand Prix Platinum                     </li>
<li>Medievil Resurrection Platinum                  </li>
<li>Pursuit Force Platinum                          </li>
<li>Ridge Racer Platinum                            </li>
<li>WipEout Pure Platinum                           </li>
<li>WRC - World Rally Championship Platinum         </li>
</ul>

Well, so basically the launch lineup. At least now I can finally buy Ridge Racer and not have a bad feeling about it ;)
