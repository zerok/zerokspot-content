title: Apple on (my) Campus
---


Just received an e-mail on the students mailing list that today and on Thursday _Apple on Campus_ will visit the University of Klagenfurt. This means a 12% discount on products like the MacMini or the MacPro and 8% on peripherals. Since I'm today all day on the University I guess I will find the time to visit their booth ;-) Now I just hope, that also people who already used up their student discount for this year get this AoC discount.

Might be a good opportunity to get a Mighty Mouse, a MacMini or a an iMac ;-) My PowerBook is still working.
