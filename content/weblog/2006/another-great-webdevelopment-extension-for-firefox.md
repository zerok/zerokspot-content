-------------------------------

[FireBug](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon.php?id=1843) is a debug and inspection tool for CSS and JavaScript offering - from what I can tell so far - basically the same as for example the [WebKit Inspector](http://webkit.opendarwin.org/blog/?p=41). After enabling the inspector, you can simply hover an element of a HTML page and it will show you, where in the HTML source code this element is situated, what styles are defined for it, what Firefox really renders (as CSS definitions), the DOM-node for it as well as what events are associated with it.



Simply cool :)
