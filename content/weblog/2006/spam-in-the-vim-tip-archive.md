title: SPAM in the VIM tip archive
---


<a href="http://weblog.zerokspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bild%201.png" class="left"><img src="http://weblog.zerokspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bild%201.thumbnail.png"/></a> Argh... now spammers have also found the [VIM tip archive](http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/index.php) for their dirty work. I just hope that this won't happen on a regular basis otherwise Scott Johnston will have to re-think adding some spam protection.
