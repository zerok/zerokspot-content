title: Crashing Gears
---


OK, it's not like "Gears of War" is crashing all the time ... in fact this was the first crash I've noticed so far, but this one was definitely at a quite inconvenient time :) I was just fighting the berserker and actually bet it, but the orbital laser also hit me on its way through the beast ... so I died. But at the same time, the mission objective of killing the berserker was accomplished which was perhaps to much for Gears' application logic ;-) 

I was kind of funny: Yeeeey, she's dead .... meeeeh, me too.

But I still love this game. For me it has nearly as much if not more atmosphere than Halo and I absolutely love the covering system.
