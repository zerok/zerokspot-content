title: Virgin learned nothing from SonyBMG drama?

Seems that way. According to <http://www.netzpolitik.org/2006/virgin-rec-kopiert-sonybmg/> Virgin appears to be putting some auto-install stuff on the current Coldplay CDs.

Well, if this is authentic its really ridiculous. But somehow I get this feeling that there is something wrong with this whole screenshot/scan/photo/whatever.



1. Since when do you burn CDs on a harddisk?

2. In #11: What is a Windows File? 

3. "Windows OS also uses the latest files" ? What files?

4. "This CD does not support Macintosh PC software"? Uhmm....



Somehow half of the statement sound a little bit fishy to me. Can anybody please confirm that this is authentic?



EDIT: Ok, it may be real, but it's simply ridiculous IMO.
