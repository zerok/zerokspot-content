title: jQuery 1.0.2 released
---


John Resig just [released a new version](http://jquery.com/blog/2006/10/09/jquery-102/) of his JavaScript library/framework [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). This release (version 1.0.2) seems to be focused on cross-browser related problems.

jQuery is a light-weight JavaScript library which is in many parts similiar to the heavyweighters such as Prototype and aims to help developers with tasks such as dynamic style-changes, AJAX etc. In the recent months jQuery seems to have gained a lot of popularity in the Drupal world and is planned to be included in the next release of the CMS (5.0.0)
