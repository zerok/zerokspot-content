<a class="left" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/166456430/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/47/166456430_7d9aff0b6f_t.jpg" width="100" height="90" alt="PICT0002.JPG" /></a>Today I finally bought my first TFT monitor after thinking about it for the better part of the last 5 years ;) It's not a high-end device, but for what I need the [940B](http://www.samsung.com/Products/Monitor/LCD_Digital/LS19HABKSXAA.asp?page=Features) is probably just right. It has a native resolution of 1280x1024 and supports things like a pivot mode ... not that I need something like that for coding, but it came with the ability to change its height (which was a requirement for me).

-------------------------------



And since I also wanted a VGA port as addition to the DVI port, the 2ms model was not an option. Not that 8ms are bad or something. And without my old Philips CRT I also have much more space on my desk ;)
