title: S5 is no longer a one-man show
---


Eric Meyer's web standards based presentation system S5 seems to be about to move out into its own project home with [s5project.org](http://s5project.org), set up by [Ryan King](http://theryanking.com/). The aim seems to be to offer all S5 users a community platform for sharing information and customizations. 

And for those of you that don't know S5 yet, think about it as PowerPoint in your web browser using XHTML, JavaScript and CSS.

For more details about what is going on with S5 and what is planed for the near future, check out the [announcement](http://s5project.org/news/2006/07/annoucing-s5projectorg.html#comments) by Ryan King :)

Hmm.... that somehow reminds me that I was actually working on an "Alternatives to PowerPoint" article when I wrote a paper a month or so ago ...
