title: My favlist of Python2.5 features
---


Long story short: Python2.5 just [got released](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/). And here a list of things I'm really looking forward playing with:

* An explicit distinction between absolute and relative imports (see the [PEP328 what's new part](http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/pep-328.html) for details)
* The new "with" statement which looks to me very much like what Ruby's doing with blocks so it basically offers code an explicit context ([PEP343 section](http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/pep-343.html)).
* And I think it's really great, that ElementTree and the new hashlib are now finally in the stdlib :-)

This is just my list based on the ["What's new" section](http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/) since I had no time playing around with 2.5 yet :-( Hopefully this will change this weekend :-)
