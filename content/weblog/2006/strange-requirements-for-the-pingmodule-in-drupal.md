title: Strange requirements for the ping.module in Drupal
---


Just a small tip: If you think, the ping.module doesn't work or something, first of all make sure, that your site has a sitename and a slog set in admin/settings. I can't really be sure for now, that that really fixed my pinging problem, but on my devel-site there is now at least the message that pinging failed \*g\* . Since there are a few firewalls between that server and the world I guess this is OK ;)
