title: LocoRoco Demo for your PSP
---


Today I finally updated my PSP to version 2.71 for basically just one reason: I wanted to give the LocoRoco demo a try. Well, no comment as always about the stupid process of updating with a 70% full battery ;) But the demo is at least quite entertaining :) After some minutes I finally noticed that rotating the world while in the air actually makes a difference *g* Now all I have to find out is if the demo level actually has an exit. 

-------------------------------





... Ok, perhaps they could have marked it with a big "EXIT" label or something or how should I know, that it is burried between these long red flowers. 



Now I just hope that the 26th as release date is really true :D
