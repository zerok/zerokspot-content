title: Drupal 5.0 beta1 released
---


Dries Buytaert announced this afternoon the first beta for the upcoming Drupal 5.0. If I remember correctly he [first planed](http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2006-10/msg00363.html) to release it some time last week, but it seems there have been some obstacles. 

-------------------------------



Now with the new default theme and a revamped admin panel and not to forgot the the jQuery integration, Drupal 5.0 might become (at least for me) the best Drupal release ever. Perhaps it will be a really nice (but busy) Christmas :)
