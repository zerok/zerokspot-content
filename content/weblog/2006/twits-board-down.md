title: TWiT's board down?
---


From time to time I really enjoy checking out the [TWiT-Army forums](http://twit.tv/forums). But for some reason the forum doesn't come up anymore. Seems like the .htaccess file over there has no exception rule for the forums anymore ;-)

-------------------------------



Since I wasn't sure if I remembered the correct URL I started playing with various other folder names quite common out there for board installations and noticed, that twit.tv also has [another board](http://twit.tv/forum/) using Drupal's own forum engine ... Well, last post was 9 weeks ago. So no real luck on this front either ;-)
