title: Timbuk2's Early 2014 Custom Laptop Messenger
---

It's not really a secret that I'm a bit of a [Timbuk2][4]-fan-boy. For quite some
time I wanted to have a new more lightweight laptop messenger which I could use
primarily when I was not riding my bike to work but that should still allow for
that. So I got the Custom Laptop Messenger last March. After now about 9 months,
I guess, it is time for a short review.

(I'm not sure what the actual model designation is here. I just bought the
custom laptop messenger in early 2014 so that's what I'll call it throughout
this post.)

--------------

The choice back then wasn't easy. Honestly, I would have preferred the
[Command][3] or the [Commute][5] because it has a water bottle holder on the
outside but it unfortunately lacks a cross-strap which is absolutely essential
for me.


## Exterior

So, after quite a lot of thinking, I went with the Custom Laptop Messenger and
got a little bit crazy with customisation. Here a word of warning: Not all the
fabrics offered for the three outside panels are as robust as Cordura or the
higher grade ballistic nylon. For one of the panels I chose a beautiful but more
lightweight blue material ("X-Pac Blue", no longer available) that has by
started to wear down on one edge of the bag. So you should definitely take that
into consideration when going the custom way.

I also picked the Silver Reflective Binding for better visibility when riding my
bike home at night. While, as with the blue fabric, it has started to wear down,
it has served me very well so far. No accidents at night so far ;-) Also, my
parents still notice it every time I visit.

While the bag lacks protective flaps (or what Crumpler calls the "Prince Charles
Protective Seal", I've used the bag in many rainy situations over the year and
it has kept is content completely dry so far. I'd still appreciate something
like that, though, given its rather high price.


## Interior

Regarding the interior aspects of this bag: It is very simplistic with a nice
padded but open laptop compartment. This is great because I don't want to wait
every time my MBP decides that it needs a glass of warm milk before going to bed
and so keeping its vents open is often necessary.

It also has a small flat pocket for a tablet or Kindle which I use all the
time. The only downside of the interior design is the option water bottle
holder-add-on, which doesn't work with *any* bottle I've tried yet (too
small). That's not really a big issue for me, though, since I just use it for my
external battery pack or some laptop cables.

My personal highlight of every Timbuk2 messenger bag I've owned so far is the
"[Napoleon Pocket][1]" which is hidden below the main flap. It's a great place for
your wallet or other small things that you want to have in reach. While it is on
the outside of the bag I'm pretty sure I'd notice anyone messing with the zipper
there, so I don't mind using it for my wallet ;-)


## Extras

There are also a bunch of addons to this bag available which I simply couldn't
resist getting. Luckily, all of them have turned out to be extremely useful:

* The Deluxe Strap Pad is a super-sized version of the normal pad you get with
  any bag. To me it feels much more comfortable and the extra reflective binding
  is great. Well worth the $10.
* Silencer Pads for the Velcro areas. These are are great when you attend a
  meeting and know you'll have to get something out of your bag. When these pads
  are attached, the clips are the only lock mechanism for the main flap, which
  you can open silently.
* The aforementioned bottle holders are not ideal for ... holding bottles but
  work for other smaller items like chargers and battery packs.

Sadly, it looks like the silencers are no longer available online, but perhaps
you can still get them in one of their stores.


## Conclusion

Despite all the minor gripes I have with this bag, I've carried it around nearly
exclusively for the last 9 months and extremely enjoyed it. The wear on the blue
fabric is a bit disappointing but most likely my own fault. I was definitely not
nice to this bag and it has probably seen the most uninterrupted use of any bag
I've ever owned. So the damaged fabric is understandable but I'm a little
worried about the binding.

Would I buy it again? Probably. The bag itself is nice but I'd definitely choose
some different material next time around. The customisable Commute is probably
the superior bag but without a cross-strap it's sadly not an option.

Also keep in mind, that this is a custom bag. If you want the customisations you
can no longer really compare it with the pre-fabricated products on the
market. Regarding my use-cases I still have to compare it with the Chrome Buran
and the Timbuk2 Especial Tres backpack. I use these two whenever I need a
heavy-duty bag; when I know that I have to carry lots of stuff, am on the bike
quite a lot, or am expecting realllllly bad weather. The Custom Laptop Messenger
is a good all-rounder (something the other two aren't simply because of their
construction or size) but for bad weather I haven't had any more reliable bags
then the Buran and the Especial Tres so far.
