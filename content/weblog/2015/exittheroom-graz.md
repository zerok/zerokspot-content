title: ExitTheRoom in Graz
---


Last Thursday we had our annual team event (Thanks Netconomy ðŸ˜Š) and for this
year we wanted to play a room-escape game. Right now there are two of these in
Graz and we went for [ExitTheRoom][etr] as it was easier too reach and thanks to
its location offered some nice dining options to spent the rest of the evening
at.

-----------

The venue is quite well hidden at [Hilgergasse 1][hg1] and there is only a small
door bell indicating that there might be a room-escape game hidden in that
building's basement. Right now they offer 3 different rooms each at a different
difficulty level:

* Prison
* Bomb
* and Madness

As we were 9 people we split up with 4 taking the Madness room while 5 of us
went into the prison for a daring break-out. I won't spoil the puzzles here but
let me just say that they were nicely prepared. As far as I can tell all where
completely mechanical so there was no situation where the moderator had to wait
for you doing something and then flip a switch for you to progress. Progressing
it totally up to you. You get a walkie-talkie and 5 free questions, but that's
it.

The atmosphere in the room I was in was great, too. Sure, there are some logic
errors due to the constraints of what you can place inside the available space
and some of the equipment you wouldn't expect anywhere even close to a prison
cell but nothing that distracts you from the quest of solving the puzzles. It's
definitely fun over authenticity but that's totally fine! There was also very
little text involved in the puzzles so knowing German was not a requirement
here.

It was simply a great hour there and I'll probably try to team up with some
folks to also give the other rooms a try ðŸ˜ƒ
