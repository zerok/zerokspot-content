This month we celebrate the 5th anniversary of the
[Python User Group Graz][website] (PyGRAZ for short)!

It all started back in 2010 at [DjangoCon Europe in Berlin][dc10] with
[Armin][ar], [Dorian][ds], and myself coming together and wondering why there
was no Django or Python-related user group in Graz. At first we weren't
completely sure what we actually wanted to end up with. Should it be something
primarily about Django? Should we focus on web-development without any language
or framework bias? In the end and after some meetings at a local coffee shop
([Tribeka][tb] at Grieskai 2) we decided to create a Python-focused user-group.

And a short time thereafter we had our first official meetup at GÃ¶sser BrÃ¤u in
[September 2010][sp10].

------------

Over the years the format evolved from simple discussions at a typical Austrian
restaurant ([GÃ¶sser BrÃ¤u][gb]) to a rotation including talks, lightning talks
and coding dojos. What we tried to keep static for as long as possible was where
the events were taking place. Once we tried to move beyond the classic "meetup
at a bar/restaurant" we found a home at the [ESC][esc] (when it was still in
JakoministraÃŸe). When they had to move out we were looking for another venue
that was ideally also used by other user groups and found the [Spektral][],
which is where we are to this date.

A big THANK YOU to the organisers of ESC and Spektral for their support!


## What we've learnt

Five years are quite a long time in which all kinds of things can go well or
fail miserably. Knocking on wood, no real disasters have hit us thus far but
we've definitely learnt a couple of things:

* PyGRAZ is still very small (usually between 8 and 12 attendees) but that's
  mostly because I'm really bad when it comes to **advertising** ðŸ˜‰ At least we
  are on [Twitter][tw], [Google+][gp] and (obviously) [meetup.com][mu] where we
  announce every event. But what has helped the most was simply asking friends
  and colleagues if they would be interested to come. It also helps during the
  organisation of each event to have one canonical info point with all other
  channels only pointing to that.

* Initially, we used both, Google+ and Meetup.com, for **RSVPs** simply because
  we wanted to make it as easy as possible for anyone to sign up. Turns out,
  this was really a pain from an organiser's point of view as getting at least
  mostly reliable numbers for things like table-reservations at restaurants gets
  far more complicated. Right now we are using Meetup.com for that exclusively,
  which also makes it really straight-forward to fetch the reservation data
  automatically through their [API][mapi].

* We haven't yet found a good solution to finding enough talks. Right now we
  have full talks every 4 months and lightning talks the months after
  that. Obviously, finding the latter is much easier as they don't require much
  preparation and people can be convinced more easily to prepare something like
  that ðŸ˜‰ Longer session slots much harder to fill, so we might end up focusing
  on lightning talks altogether.

* Sponsors and how to deal with that side of the equation is still in flux with
  us. Some user groups rely heavily on sponsors for their location, snacks and
  probably also their speakers as well as other aspects of keeping the lights
  on. So far we haven't done that. Spektral, thankfully, hosts us for free but
  that also means that everyone has to pay for their drinks by
  themselves. Personally, I'm absolutely fine with that but we might discuss
  some different approaches in the future.


## To the future!

Before coming to the end of this post I really would like to thank everyone who
ever came to our meetups and/or gave a talk. Without you, PyGRAZ would not
exist! Another thank you goes to our friends from the
[Python user group in Vienna][vi] who've for many years now shared their
Meetup.com account with us!

We somehow have to connect all these groups better with each other... Sounds
like a nice goal for the next five years ðŸ˜‰

As for the near future: There is another meetup taking place in just a couple of
weeks at October 6 where we will once again do a coding dojo. You can find more
details (as always) on [our website][website] ðŸ˜ƒ
