title: Hunting for the Highscore in Swarm again!
---


Finally! The big geo-location game is back! A couple of years ago, when
Foursquare was still the simple check-in app, the highscore list between friends
was one of the highlights of any conference trip for me. It ended up being a
race of who sees the most of each host city!

With the split into Foursquare and Swarm that got lost. Stickers were nice and
good but Swarm was far from being as enjoyable as the hunt for a highscore
between friends. Now public mayorships and an improved version of the
highscore-game are back in Swarm and I canâ€™t wait for the next conference trip
to happen ðŸ˜€

As with everything in Swarm mayorship and highscores are presented much more
color- and playful now than they ever were in the old Foursquare app. It's a
game and it deserves to be portrayed as such ðŸ˜‰ For instance, you now collect
coins instead of points which makes it kind of feel like a Mario game.

Alongside the [feature announcement on the companyâ€™s blog][1] J. Crowley also wrote a
[lengthy blog post][2] about how they got there again.
