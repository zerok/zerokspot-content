title: This was FOSDEM 2015
---


For a very long time now I've wanted to go to [FOSDEM][1] and last weekend I
finally did it! And except for the really horrible weather it definitely lived
up to what I had hoped it would be like. For those of you who don't know it,
FOSDEM is one of the largest annual Free Software and open source gatherings in
the world with about 5000 attendees and it's FREE!

The event has been taking place for the last 14 years at the campus of the
[Free University of Brussels (ULB)][2] which this year provided 25 rooms for the
event where most of them are then handed over in the form of so-called
[devrooms][3]. In these rooms sub-communities like for instance Python, Mozilla,
or Go organise the sessions and also moderate them. I've only attended 4 dev
rooms while there but this whole concept seems to work great for scaling such an
event.

--------

## The tracks

Last year I had heard stories that these devrooms and especially Go's tend to be
completely full so people can no longer enter, but I didn't expect this to be
such a wide-spread issue. Sadly, on Saturday I faced quite a few closed doors
but being persistent eventually got me into each track I wanted to, even the Go
devroom on Sunday.

Surprising myself, I spent most of Saturday in the [Legal and Policy Issues][4]
track listening to talks about the GNOME vs. Groupon- and RhodeCode
vs. GPL-battles and other sessions about licensing related issues. I learnt
quite a few things about GPLv3 that I hadn't known before and I might even
consider it for some future projects after that.

On Sunday I went to talks from the [Mozilla][5]-, [Go][6]- and
[Security][7]-tracks learning more about HTTP/2.0, Bleve and OpenPGP key signing
(and what a complete mess that still is). The day ended with an absolute
highlight: A presentation about the Mars One project and how this might be a
great chance for FOSS. Can't wait to watch that one again once the videos are
out.

## The venue and everything around and between sessions

There was actually so much to see that I didn't really take enough time to cool
down and get anything beyond snacks to eat. In general the whole structure of
the event facilitates that by placing food trucks between the buildings housing
the sessions. While I enjoy snacks like Frites, Hamburgers, Waffles, and more as
much as the next guy, some fresh fruits would have been awesome. But perhaps I
just didn't see the healthy options ;-)

A big part of FOSDEM seems to be beer and below the main track there was a small
bar where attendees could purchase beer out of a selection of about 15
brands. And since I didn't notice anyone being drunk or rude because of that I
consider the option to have beer directly at a conference to be awesome!

The whole "beer as a feature" thing actually started before the main conference
with a special event on Friday evening. Sadly, after getting up at 3am that day
and visiting the Atomium I was far too tired to make it out of my hotel room in
the afternoon and so I missed that one. I'm not sure if I'd have actually
enjoyed it, though, considering some of the [pictures][8] I saw of the huge
crowd that was there.

And that was basically my only big problem with FOSDEM as a whole. I don't
really enjoy large groups of people. PyCon is also quite large but nothing
compared to FOSDEM and it was very exhausting. Will this keep me from attending
in the future? Probably not, but at least now I can prepare for it. Since this
was my first time there I wanted to suck up as much knowledge as possible and
"see everything". Won't do that again ;-) On Sunday evening I even opted for not
taking a bus back to my hotel and instead walked the 5km distance in the
rain... snow... rain... Yes, the weather was really awful.


## Newly excited for ...

Every event I go to somehow managed to excite me for something. And so did
FOSDEM for these:

* Free Software in general. I'm normally more in the Open Source camp but ever
  since I started messing around with Emacs nearly two months ago I've come to
  appreciate the "more radical" if you will part of the FOSS community. Heck, I
  even consider using the GPL for possible future projects again ...
* Rust. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy Go and the community around it very much and
  thanks to its awesome cross-platform support I don't see Rust as a direct
  competitor here. So why should I not mess around with it in the future?!
* Linux on the desktop: So many Thinkpads running Linux there ... Have to give
  it a try again.

So, to conclude: FOSDEM is awesome! If you are into Free and OpenSource Software
and you have an open spot in your schedule for February, go there. Unless you
really don't enjoy large groups of people.
