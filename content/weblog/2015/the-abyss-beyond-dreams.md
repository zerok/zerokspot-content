title: The Abyss Beyond Dreams
---


Peter F. Hamilton's latest story from the Commonwealth universe takes the reader
back into the Void before the events of [The Dreaming Void][4]. As with most
prequels reading [The Abyss Beyond Dreams][2] doesn't make much sense if you
haven't read the Void Trilogy. At least that's the only explanation I could come
up with for reviews like [this][1].

This first part of the new [The Chronicle of the Fallers duology][3] fits very
neatly into the pattern of the previous Void books and explains a couple of
things that were left open there. It also finally tells the story of the Brant
expedition that at the time of the previous stories had been missing for nearly
1000 years. Contrary to the other Void books the story here takes place inside
this micro-universe nearly exclusively. As such it most of the time feels less
like hard SciFi and more like an alternative history or fantasy tale. If you
enjoyed these parts of the trilogy books, you will love this one! Add Nigel
Sheldon into the mix and you have a wonderful book in front of you.

Just don't expect a return to Querencia (the planet from the first three
books). Instead the author presents you a new planet but with similar structures
and perhaps a bit too familiar characters and habits. And this is actually the
only aspect of the book I can criticise. Everything about Bienvenido feels a bit
too close to what we had on Querencia with Edeard. But that's what we have Nigel
here for. He's also the one who single-handedly keep this book in the
SciFi-category.

What a great book to start a year and I can't wait for the second story (I
really hope the rumoured 2016-release-date isn't true)!
