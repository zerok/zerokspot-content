title: Conferences for 2015 (part 1)
---


Last year has been an awesome year for my little conference-tourism habit. At
the end of the year I had attended seven events in six countries and learnt so
much! This year is also already shaping up to be great. These are the events I
plan to be at in the first half of the year:

* For a very long time I've wanted to attend [FOSDEM][2] and this January 31st
  and February 1st I'm finally going to make it! For those of you who don't know
  it, it's probably the largest open-source gathering in Europe that every year
  draws many thousands of developers and hackers to Brussels. There are tons of
  events by sub-communities for Python, Go, Ruby, ... And it is free!

* [.conc.at()][1] is a new development conference taking place on the 7th of
  March in Salzburg, Austria. The speaker lineup already looks really nice! I'm
  not yet sure if I'll be able to attend but I'll definitely try.

* I enjoyed last year's [PyCon][3] in Montr√©al so much I simply had to attend it
  this year again. It is just an amazing event to be at if you're even remotely
  interested in Python and the community surrounding it. The conference will
  take place from April 8th until April 16th with tutorials, talks, sprints,
  workshops, and much more.

* The last conference I've planned for the first half of 2015 will be
  [DjangoCon Europe 2015][4] from May 31st to June 5th. I've been to nearly
  every previous event of this series (with the exception of last year's) and
  absolutely loved every single one of them. Combined with being once again in
  Cardiff (which I visited for the first time last year for the
  [Django Weekend][5]) it's an opportunity hard to miss!

I haven't really looked yet for conferences for the second half. Last year's
dotGo and dotJS were great fun so I might go there again and O'Reilly seems to
resurrect the European edition of OSCON which - back in 2005 - was my very first
software development conference.

Do you perhaps have any suggestions for awesome events (preferably in Europe)?
