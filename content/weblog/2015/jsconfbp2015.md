title: JSConf Budapest 2015
---


Back in January on my hunt for conferences I've never been to I stumbled upon
[JSConf Budapest][jsconfbp]. I had never been to the Hungarian capital before so
it immediately went on my list of events I wanted to go to. I told [Christoph][]
about it and we started planning our trip to the event that took place last
week.

-------

If I would have to describe that trip in just one word, "perfect" would probably
be it. I enjoyed every single talk, which is great for a single-track
conference. Picking favorites out of these is hard but these would be mine (in
no particular order):

* [Functional UIs and Unidirectional Dataflow][t1] by Mikael Brevik
* [We fail to follow SemVer â€“ and why it neednâ€™t matter][t2] by Stephan BÃ¶nnemann
* [Dancing with the Robots][t3] by Julian Cheal
* [JavaScript for Virtual Reality][t4] by Liv Erickson
* ... just watch them all once they are made available on Youtube!

The venue was the [UrÃ¡nia FilmszÃ­nhÃ¡z][urania], an old cinema from the end of
the 19th century in the heart of the city with lots of gold and red carpets.
What set it apart from other theaters I've been to for conferences is that
everything was sized just perfectly for ~300 attendees (legroom!!!). The
catering definitely deserves a special mention, too: There was breakfast (a real
one) and lunch on both days and dinner at the first, and everything was just
phenomenal with tons of tasty local dishes! Again no fruits and flaky WiFi on
the first day but that's what you get at every conference nowadays ðŸ˜‰

There were also two evening events with enough space to meet new people have
interesting conversions. In general the whole event was organized in a way that
made networking really easy ðŸ˜€

To summarize: JSConf Budapest was an amazing event at an awesome venue and I
can't wait to be back in Budapest next year!

P.S.: You can find more posts about this trip on my [travelogue][tl] with
hopefully more to come in the next couple of days.
