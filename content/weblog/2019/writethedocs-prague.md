Over the course of the last few days I was, once again, in Prague for
[WriteTheDocs Prague][wtd]. Sadly, I had missed the event last year
but this time I absolutely wanted to go again and blocked the time as
early as possible in my calendar. It was well worth the effort!

Compared to the last time I went (in [2017][]), the audience has grown
considerably. Gone are the days when the doors to the main conference
hall could be closed, seperating the foyer from the seating area. Now,
the seats reach into the foyer and so the food buffets had to be moved
into the room that was previously reserved for hallway-track hacking
and smaller gatherings.

Also new was a [job fair][jf] on the second conference day with
various companies looking for writers. Sadly, some of the sponsors
opted to leave their table empty (I'm looking at you, Mozilla) but the
others appeared to have been well-staffed and well-frequented by the
audience!


## Side events

All in all, the event seems to have become even better while I was
gone, with even more stuff to do than what the conference and
un-conference alone had to offer. I also, for the first time, managed
to go on the boat-ride on the [Vltava][]! And what a great event that
was!  While there was no official tour guide and attendees were asked
to simply ask those who had already been on the tour before, I got so
many beautiful pictures out of it, I'm still working through them.

On Monday evening there was also once again the big conference
party. This time it took place at [eRko Gastro Pub][erko], a really
nice bar + restaurant near [Náměstí Míru][nm]. The event was supposed
to only include some light snacks but the staff there outdid
themselves with delicious fingerfood (tartare, chicken fingers, pate,
...) and vegetarian curry with rice! The food was so great that we
regretted going for dinner before the event!

eRko definitely made it onto our list of places we would have to come
back to in the next years...


## Talks

OK, enough about the "infrastructure" and on to the core of the event:
the talks!

Once again the mix was excellent! If you're looking for experience
reports from API documentation over to docs-as-code to localization
handling, you could find it here. The talks should be up on YouTube in
the near future, so even if you missed the conference *and* the
live-streams, you can still watch them via the [WriteTheDocs
channel][yt].

Out of 15 talks, my personal highlights were (in no particular order)
...

* "Found in Translation: Lessons from a Year of Open Source
  Localization" by [Zachary Sarah Corleissen][zsc] which was all about
  the learnings of the [CNCF][] and the [Kubernetes project][k8s]
  after having managed to organize localization offers for multiple
  language communities.
* "The UK government meets docs as code" by [Jen Lambourne][jl] was
  basically a choose-your-own-adventure-style story about how a part
  of the UK government worked on improving their documentation tooling
  over the years and what key-decisions they had to make (and
  sometimes make all over again).
* "How to write the perfect error message" by [James Scott][js]
  collecting some dos and donts of error messages, and how important it
  is to treat them seriously and get them right.
  
Sadly, I didn't manage to get downstairs for the unconference but I
hope to find some write-ups about the sessions!

So, that's that: Another WTD, another great event! I want to thank all
the organizers and volunteers for some great days in Prague and am
really looking forward to seeing all of you again next year. There is
still some hope that I will even be able to make it to [Portland next
year][wtdpl2020]...
