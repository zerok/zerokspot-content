In a [recent episode of "Logbuch Netzpolitik"][lnp317] Linus Neumann
and Tim Pritlove interviewed Sebastian JÃ¼nemann, founder of the
humanitarian NGO [Cadus][c]. During this interview he explains how
they provide strategic and technical solutions to local partners in
crisis areas like Rojava (Northern Syria) and Iraq.

Given their limited financial resources they try to implement
technical projects themselves, where off-the-shelf solutions would be
far too expensive. They do so using their own Makerspace in which
they've, for instance, built [mobile hospitals][mh] and are trying to
improve their [airdrop system][aeru] in cooperation with the
[Humanitarian Pilot Initiative][hpi]. Cadus also has people on site
in Syria (and Iraq) where they are working on a [field hospital in the
al-Hawl refugee camp][fh].

This sounds amazing and their [donation form][df] is extremely
userfriendly ðŸ˜‰
