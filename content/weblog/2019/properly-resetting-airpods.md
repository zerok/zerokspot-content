Whenever I ride my bike I also want to listen to some podcasts with
one ear, so too today. Sadly, my new AirPods didn't agree with that
plan and refused to pair with my phone for some reason. Whenever I
started podcast player the earphones would be marked for a second as
connected and then all of a sudden the connection was lost. After a
few attempts at unpairing and re-pairing without any real improvement
I gave up and rode home without any podcast.

What was weird, though, was that for some reason sometimes only one of
the AirPods connected to my phone while the other looked like being
associated with a completely different case. Re-pairing sometimes
switched which one was recognized as "my AirPods" by my phone,
sometimes not.

Anyway, I started to look into how to reset them and stumbled upon
[this guide][g] on Apple's website:

> 1. On your iOS device, go to Settings \
>    Go to Settings > Bluetooth and tap the "i" icon next to your
>    AirPods.2 Then tap Forget This Device, and tap again to confirm.
> 2. Put your AirPods in their case \
>    Close the lid. Wait 30 seconds, then open the lid.
> 3. Reset your AirPods \
>    Press and hold the setup button on the back of the case until you see the status light flash amber a few times, then flash white continuously.
> 4. Reconnect your AirPods \
>    Place your AirPods close to your device. Follow the steps on your device's screen.

I had misinterpreted the instructions in step 3 thinking I only need
to hold the button until the light flashes red. This way, I somehow
managed to only reset half of the earphones with the other half being
associated with some other non-existant charging case.

So: Hold the setup button until the light flashes red **and continue
holding it** until it is white again!
