After skipping 2017 due to some travel difficulties my gf and I again
managed to attend last year's Congress in Leipzig. We were both a bit
sceptical how the event would turn out as both of us had enjoyed the
last two events in Hamburg despite the location being filled probably
beyond capacity.

It turned out that our worries were unfounded: The congress center in
Leipzig was the perfect place for the
[35C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)!
Broad walkways, huge, open areas for the assemblies, and even
community-organized sub-conferences like the ChaosWest stage.

There was (as expected) so much to see, that I only managed to attend a
handful of sessions:

- [The Precariat: A Disruptive Class for Disruptive
  Times.](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-10021-the_precariat_a_disruptive_class_for_disruptive_times)
- [Taming the Chaos: Can we build systems that actually
  work?](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9647-taming_the_chaos_can_we_build_systems_that_actually_work)
- [Mind the Trap: Die Netzpolitik der AfD im
  Bundestag](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9513-mind_the_trap_die_netzpolitik_der_afd_im_bundestag)

Weirdly enough, I saw more talks after returning home...

- [Freude ist nur ein Mangel an
  Information](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9506-freude_ist_nur_ein_mangel_an_information)
- [Security Nightmares
  0x13](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9685-security_nightmares_0x13)
- [Hackerethik - eine
  Einführung](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-10011-hackerethik_-_eine_einfuhrung)
- ["The" Social Credit
  System](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9904-the_social_credit_system)
- [Archäologische Studien im
  Datenmüll](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9858-archaologische_studien_im_datenmull)
- [Internet of Dongs](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9523-internet_of_dongs)


My personal highlight, though, was a short introduction by Eva
Fitzelová and Johannes Mueller of the
[Esperanto](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Esperanto_%E2%80%93_a_planned_nerd_language_actually_spoken)
language. Before going there I had known virtually nothing about the
language except that it was an artificial one. I left with a lot of
appreciation for the language and a wish learn more as soon as time
permits.

Most my time was spent around the assemblies, though. There, we
attended a soldering workshop, had awesome crepes, bauzi, and lots of
Flora Power!

Unlike my two previous Congresses I also managed to angel a bit, first
as trash-angel and then also as bottle-angel. Sadly, I didn't do many
hours but it was a start and I will do more next time! And there
definitely will be a next time ... hopefully in less than 10 months!
