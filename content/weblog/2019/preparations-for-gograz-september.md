We are about to change a few things regarding the local [Go meetup in
Graz](https://gograz.org/) this months. First of all: A new
time. While we previously had the meetup at the 3rd Tuesday every
month, we've moved to the 2nd Monday in order to avoid collisions with
other groups (and the Infracoders in particular). You can find the
details in the notes for our [June
meetup](https://gograz.org/meetup/2019-06-18/).

We will also try to have a presentation every month now followed by
optional lightning talks. We, most likely, won't do recordings in the
near future but we will ask potential speakers that they send us their
slides so that we can build up a usable archive of talks on
[gograz.org](https://gograz.org) in a similar way to what
[pygraz.org](https://pygraz.org) has. This will also make it easier to
promote the meetup. Historically, publishing only to
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/grazgophers) wasn't enough, so we will
also try to push event updates through other channels like University
mailinglists, internal company channels etc. If you know of any
platforms (except for Facebook please) that might make sense here,
please let me know!

As for the talks, this time, I will give a short introduction into
[Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/), a graph database written in Go. I've
been playing around with Dgraph in the context of a personal project
of mine and thought it might be fun to show you what you can do with a
datastore that operates on graphs instead of columns or key-value
pairs!

The talk will most likely not include as much Go code as I'd like
(simply because I'm lazy and am just using a Jupyter Notebook as
presentation platform), but I will at least should how to get started,
add some data to the database and query it. I'm only about half way
through the slides so far, but I still have 8 more days to go ðŸ™‚
