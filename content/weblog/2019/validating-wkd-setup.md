title: Validating my WKD setup

Right after writing [Signed GPG keys and keyservers][sk], [Wiktor][]
contact me, suggesting that using a [Web Key Directory][wkd] might be
the better approach to solving my signed-keys-exchange problem. He
also noticed that I had uploaded my GPG key in the wrong format, so
receiving it via WKD only worked for GnuPG users.

Because of that I thought about playing a little bit around with how
URLs are calculated for WKD and create a little validation utility:

```
$ wkd-validate 'horst@zerokspot.com'

$ wkd-validate 'horst1@zerokspot.com'
11:45AM FTL Failed to validate WKD content. error="received status code 404 while fetching key via WKD"
```

You can find the implementation [on Github][gh]
