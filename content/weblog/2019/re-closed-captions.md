Recently, [Jason
Kottke](https://kottke.org/19/04/why-everyone-is-watching-tv-with-closed-captioning-on-these-days)
summarised a Twitter thread about why people who can hear normally and
also understand the language use closed captions when watching video
content.

I also watch as much as possible on Netflix or on my tablet in general
using subtitles simply because it helps me to understand names
better. I’m very bad with names and even more so when I only hear
them. Reading or especially writing a name does something with my
memory that marks it as more relevant for me which makes remembering
them easier. Subtitles therefore help me untangle dialogues where
people talk about other people. Without them I’d either have to
rewatch many exchanges or to reconstruct them later on.

That being said, I’m also someone who prefers watching videos with
headphones. While we have a good audio setup for the big TV, if I
watch things on my own (even when I’m alone) I prefer the sound
isolation of my headphones. No matter how loud explosions are, I don’t
even have to think of this might disturb someone else. Therefore, I
only use closed captions in addition to the audio track of a video but
not as a replacement.

Nevertheless, closed captions are simply a great example of a feature
that was originally aimed at a specific user group but then turned out
to be useful to pretty much everyone but not all the time. Watching
videos without them would be far less enjoyable for me!
