When looking at a "normal" work setup in an IT-heavy company you
normally see at least two screens per work-place. For some reason,
people assume that they get more done and don't miss anything
important when they can have all their most important applications
open at the same time and visible. Peeking over some coworker's
shoulder it is quite common, for instance, that I see Slack or some
e-mail client of their choice on one screen while and their IDE/editor
or browser on the other.

At the same time, whenever I move to a new table at work, many are
baffled when they see me just opening my laptop and seemingly
forgetting to plug the external screen in for days or even weeks. The
main reason for that is that I cannot really focus with too much going
on on my screens. All I want and need is a single screen with only the
one application I'm currently working with being either in full-screen
mode or maximized. Only on some rare occasion do I need to have an
editor and a preview-like window or documentation window open at the
same time. Then I simply do a 50%:50% split and reset that again once
I'm done.

Quite some time ago (in 2017) [Cory House wrote on Hacker Noon][c]
about why he preferred a single high-resolution display over multiple
displays which mirrors my reasoning quite well. I'm currently using a
27" display alongside my laptop at work. The *only* app that is ever
on the smaller sidecar-display (in this case my laptop's) is
OmniFocus. It doesn't have any notifications, no blinking, no
nothing. It's also never the primary focus but only something that
helps me put my current work in context.

That being said, the 27" screen feels a bit too large so I will most
likely give a 24" screen a try in the near future. At home, for
instance, I'm mostly using just my 13" laptop screen and that setup
works quite well for me. Sure, 15" would be better but it's a
trade-off between weight/portability and screen-size. The additional
2" simply weren't worth it for me.

Something I've never completely warmed up to is the concept of having
multiple virtual desktops. I've tried them again and again for the
last 20 years, first on Linux and later on macOS, but I never found a
configuration that had benefits over just fullscreen + alt-tabbing. If
you use virtual desktops please let me know about your setup!
