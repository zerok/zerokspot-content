It's extremely rare that I visit a concert. Actually, I'm pretty sure that I've only been on four or five. The first one was by a Styrian band called "[EAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erste_Allgemeine_Verunsicherung)". They are known for their witty lyrics, slightly provoking shows, and catchy tunes. I'm pretty sure there are only very few people in Austria (and to some degree Germany) who don't know this band.

Last year the band announced that they would go on one last tour and then shut down the band. The core members ([Thomas Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Spitzer) and [Klaus Eberhartinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Eberhartinger)) are now close to 70, so it probably felt like a good time for that. 

Back when I was a teenager, I absolutely loved EAV and, as I wrote before, my very first concert was one of theirs back in the 1990s. I simply had to get a ticket for one of their very lasts concerts. And what an evening that was üòç

While I remembered their lyrics to be over-the-top and to some degree provoking, I completely forgot how political they were. In between playing some of their hits from the last decades the band around Eberhartinger and Spitzer also did some new interpretations with updated lyrics, bringing them into the 21st century. Klaus Eberhartinger also gave each song a little bit of context with some witty comments about current (mostly political) topics.

Let's say it this way: People more on the right end of the political spectrum probably enjoyed the event far less than I did üòÖ

If this sounds like something for you and you understand German, do yourself a favour and [get a ticket](http://www.eav.at/konzerte/2019). There are still some left!
