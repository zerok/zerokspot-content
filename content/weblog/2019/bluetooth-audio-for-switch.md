A couple of days ago I finally had a chance to play around with the
[GENKI Audio][ga] adapter for the Nintendo Switch I had ordered before
the winter holidays. For those who haven't heard about that yet, it's
a Bluetooth Audio adapter that you plug into the USB-C port of the
Switch and it will allow you to bind two pairs of headphones or other
audio output devices to the console.

Pairing is straight-forward: I removed one of my devices from the
[connection manager][conn] of my [Bose QC35II][qc], hit one of the
two pairing buttons at the Genki and a second later I heard the
soundtrack of [Wargroove][wg]. When I stopped playing, I had to
explicitly disable the Genki inside Bose Connect again because
otherwise it would stay connected. I guess, the other option would
have been to remove the adapter from the Switch...

I still don't get who at Nintendo thought it was not a big deal not to
include Bluetooth Audio support but you can at least get around this
shortcoming until a new iteration of the console gets released.
