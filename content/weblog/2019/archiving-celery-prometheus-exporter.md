When I started the [celery-prometheus-exporter][cpe] project back in
[May 2016][init] I needed a way to monitoring the worker queue in an
internal project at work. Over the year's, though, that project and
therefore the exporter has faded into the background so I lacked time
to keep it properly maintained.

{{<figure src="/media/2019/cpe-archived.png" caption="celery-prometheus-exporter is in read-only mode">}}

The next iteration of the project I was using CPE for might not even
have Celery or Django in it anymore so I decided to archive the
exporter. I want to take this opportunity to thank those who
contributed over the years:

- [Rupert Angermeier][rangermeier]
- [Gabriel Abdalla Cavalcante][gcavalcante8808]
- [Brett Randal][javabrett]
- [Roberto Barreda][robertobarreda]
- [Dimitris Rozakis][dimrozakis]
- [Dmitriy][zokalo]
- [Neil Chudleigh][nchudleigh]
- [Gautier MATHON][gmathon-ovh]
- [Kostya Esmukov][KostyaEsmukov]

If the project has been useful to you, please fork and improve it ðŸ™‚
There are still tons of things that could be worked on but I simply
lack the time to even coordinate the work there. Hence I see archiving
this repository as the only responsible way. I will keep this
repository online as long as possible! Sorry for any inconvenience
this action causes and thanks for your understanding!
