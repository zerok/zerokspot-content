Thanks to [a tweet by Eric Holscher][eh] I stumbled upon the [XOXO
Festival][xoxo] which is currently taking place in Portland, OR. I'm
currently looking for an excuse to finally get back to the city next
year and I hadn't heard of XOXO before so I set out to dig a little
deeper:

> XOXO is an experimental festival celebrating independent artists and
> creators working on the internet. Each year, XOXO brings together
> writers, designers, filmmakers, musicians, game developers, coders,
> cartoonists, and more to share their stories and struggles of living
> and working online.

I'm usually not all that interested in the indie-scene but with the
revival of decentralized technologies and mindsets with tools like
[ActivityPub][ap], [IPFS][], and [Scuttlebutt][sbt] there might also
be some interesting content for people like me ðŸ™‚ Two out of four days
also have a conference-segment with talks by authors, musicials,
YouTubers, and podcasters. Sadly, I couldn't find any gamedev or
coder-talks on the schedule.

That being said, there are tons of side-events outside of that
conference track like a whole [day full of Slack meetups][sm] in
various places all over Portland including an event about the indieweb
and a bookclub meetup at one of my favorite places: [Base Camp
Brewing][bcb].

So while this alone might not be enough to justify getting a
plane-ticket and flying there for two weeks, perhaps I can find
another event in the same time-window next year. I just wish it were
closer to [WriteTheDocs][wtd] ðŸ˜¢
