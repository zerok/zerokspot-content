As part of our summer vacation we decided to spent a week in Carinthia at WÃ¶rthersee. Since we always have a family party in mid-August near PÃ¶rtschach, we opted to get a hotel in walking distance and after some research picked [Gasthof Joainig](https://www.sagers.at/en/hotel-joainig/hotel/joainig-at-the-woerthersee.html) due to its proximity to both the lake and the party venue.

At around 200 EUR per night it wasn't cheap but we got lots of value out of that price ðŸ™‚ The rooms were spacious, modern, and beautiful. While they didn't have air conditioning, most of the time the temperature was pleasant enough with some old-school ventilation helping out and we had a large balcony with enough room for two people to sit comfortably.

Part of the offer was also access to the wellness area of the hotel which included a sauna and a beautiful relaxing area with water beds. There was also a fitness room available, which sadly was a bit on the small side.

My personal highlight, though, was each morning's  breakfast. The buffet offered, for instance, a selection of fresh bread (white, dark, mixed, ...) and a small grill-section where you could order your breakfast-eggs the way you like them. They also had [Segafredo](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segafredo_Zanetti) coffee and hot chocolate, which turned out being surprisingly delicious (in the past I hadn't liked Segafredo products)!

The staff was also exceptionally friendly and competent. It just made a huge difference when you're greeted every morning with a smile!

After most of the days being spent bathing in the near lake with the family, we also spent quite a few evenings at the hotel restaurant (for which you should better get reservations if you want to have a seat!) and very much enjoyed every single one of them. Once, we had a rather tight time-schedule due to a trip to the cinema but the whole kitchen and waiter staff managed to deliver everything exactly on-time!

In general, we really enjoyed our time at Gasthof Joainig. While I'd really love to also have air-conditioning in the rooms it wasn't really a deal-breaker and I'd gladly stay there again! Yes, there are cheaper places but our expectations were not only met but exceeded (the rooms were really beautiful and that breakfast... ðŸ˜…)!
