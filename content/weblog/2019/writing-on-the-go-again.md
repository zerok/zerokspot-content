For the last couple of year's I've been mostly blogging from my laptop. The primary reason for that is that I simply love the way MacBook keyboards feel. The pressure points are just perfect and writing on them just fills me with joy ðŸ¥° [Two years ago](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2017/05/17/mobile-writing/) now I tried to improve my mobile setup, though, with the [Keys-to-go keyboard by Logitech][kb] in order to finally make writing on the go practical. That keyboard was small, light, but it had one downside: As I had bought it in the US during my last Portland trip, it had an US layout and not the international version of it. While this shouldn't be a big problem, I somehow never got used to the size of the return-key. Sadly, after a year of use, it started to become unreliable (some keys stopped working on one day but they worked again later) and so I replaced it with a newer version of the same series, this time with the German keyboard layout.

Sadly, Logitech had changed the material the keys were coated in over the years. This was probably mostly done to make the keyboard more water-resistant but it also changed the pressure points to make the keys feel harder. I'm not yet sure that I like this change, but over the next weeks I want to write most of my posts using this keyboard. Perhaps I can finally write more of the posts here on the go using a combination of [iA Writer][ia] and [Working Copy][wc] ðŸ˜…
