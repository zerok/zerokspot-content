taking place next year between May 16 and May 17 in Portland, OR üòÅ
OK, a convention about a card-game?! I know, but for some reason I
really would like to go to [Burning Cat][bc]. It's just something
completely different from what I normally do.

Playing something like [Exploding Kittens][ek] or [UNO][] usually
makes lots of fun but there is always the problem of finding enough
people who actually want to play... and I don't distracted by a book
or some video game üòâ

Anyway, having a 2-day-long game-night sounds like a decent solution
for that problem! Will I actually be able to attend? I'm not sure but
perhaps I could combine it with [WriteTheDocs Portland][wtd], which
takes place ... two weeks earlier üòû But who knows, perhaps I can find
something else that would fill that gap...

Or, perhaps, I should simply try to motivate myself and a couple of
friends to do regular game-nights here without having to book hotels,
plane tickets, and so on. But hey, that would probably be way to easy
and simple to actually work.
