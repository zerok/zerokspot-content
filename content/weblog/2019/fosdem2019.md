Another February, another trip to Brussels for
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2019/) is behind me and for the first time
I actually caught a real and quite severe cold there... Despite that
not-so-happy end I once again enjoyed my time in Brussels! I also
wanted to change my talk schedule a bit and decided not even to try
getting into the Go room. Instead, I spent a surprising amount of time
at the security and Mozilla devrooms thanks to talks by Daniel
Stenberg (about [HTTP/3][h3]) and Hans de Raad (about the [EU
Cybersecurity Act][csa]).

Probably my personal highlights, though, happened to be the keynotes
inside Janson:

- [Mattermost's Approach to Layered Extensiblity in OpenSource][mm] by
  Corey Hullen where he describes all the extension points that are
  available to customize your Mattermost experience as
  admin/developer.
- [Matrix in the French State][mat] where Matthew Hodgson introduces
  Matrix and also tells the story of how one big "customer" (if you
  will) introduces many new and interesting user-cases to the project.
- [The cloud is just another sun][sun] by Kyle Rankin and [50 years of
  UNIX and Linux advantages][50y] by maddog in which both speakers
  remind us why we're all here (at a FOSS event and in the community
  in general) and also that what happens right now with "the cloud" is
  more similar than not to what we had ~30 years ago during the Unix
  wars.
  
On the tram to the conference each morning or at latest during the
first talks I tried to come up with a list of sessions I wanted to
attend that day. For the first time, I actually managed to see at
least about half of them and (again a first) after returning to Graz
on Monday even saw some of those that I missed at home.

Some of the talks were so motivating that I'm currently considering or
in the process of installing my own [Nextcloud][nc] and [Matrix][mx]
servers. Worst case: I waste a couple of Euros and dump both of them
over the next months. I think I can live with that. Perhaps the only
topic that I missed this time: There was only a single talk about
Emacs. That and the FSFE booth didn't seem to have any Emacs stickers!
Well, all the more reason to come back again next year!
