In the most recent episode of the ["Denkangebot" podcast][d] [Katharina Nocun][k] talks about a hot topic right now: [far-right movements and the parallel worlds they exist in][p] and how Germany has been handling them for the last 40 years. In nearly 110 minutes packed with interviews, background information, and also personal experience reports she manages to offer quite a detailed look from the outside into that scene that some of us would love to completely ignore. Given that the local right-wing party AfD is now in pretty much every federal institution there, though, casting a light on them and the rest of the right wing, and if and how they are connected is now more important than ever.

This podcast is only available in German, but if you know the language, give it a try! It will be well worth your time!
