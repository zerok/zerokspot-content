Last year I wrote a little bit about incoming support for [detecting
dark mode in CSS][d]. Ever since I had added the prefers-color-scheme
media query to [servethis][s] in late September, I wanted to also play
around with it here.

While I want to eventually provide a button similar to what [Max
BÃ¶ck][m] has on his website so that you, the reader, can explicitly
select either dark or light mode, this first iteration uses only the
CSS selector.

In the next days and weeks I will probably also fine-tune the CSS a
bit as a stumble upon some rough edges. I hope, though, that you enjoy
this "new" look and find it pleasant to read in the dark ðŸ™‚

If not, please let me know!
