After a lot of thinking I've finally removed the comments form from zerokspot.com. Over the last couple of years there were usually just one or two comments **per year** coming in through this channel. On the other side, Disqus has more and more  become an ad-network and if there is one thing I donâ€™t want to have on my personal website then that would be ads.

Additionally, if I link to my articles on Twitter, Mastodon, or more recently dev.to I tend to get at least some "likes" but quite often also some concrete feedback and comments. So after many years the day has finally come and Disqus is gone again from this site ðŸ™‚

If you have made a Disqus account, you can still access your comments and I might also import existing comments in the future. I donâ€™t have any concrete plans for that yet, though.
