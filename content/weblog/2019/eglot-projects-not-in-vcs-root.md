After switching from lsp-mode to [eglot][] recently, I ran into a
weird issue today: When opening a work-project eglot+gopls basically
bailed on me. All I got was this error message:

```
Your workspace root is /path/monorepo, but your module root is /path/monorepo/project.
```

This message was emitted by gopls which is reacting to an `initialize`
call with a [root path][rp] that doesn't match the information it can
find inside the local `go.mod` file.

OK, so where is that "root path" coming from? Internally, eglot uses
the function [`project-current`][pc] which is part of the `project.el`
library. Sadly, this function, out of the box, seems to only support
detecting project root folders by looking at various VCS metadata. In
my case though, `/path/monorepo` is the one that contains the `.git`
folder while `/path/monorepo/project` doesn't.

As a quick fix I thought, I could just add a `.projectile` file (since
I'm using [projectile][] anyway) to the project directory and let
`(project-current)` detect that. project.el offers an extension point
for detecting project folders with the `project-find-functions`
hook. Luckily, Louis Roch√© seems to have faced a similar issue and
provided that little snippet in his [emacs.d repository][e]:

```
(defun my-projectile-project-find-function (dir)
  (let ((root (projectile-project-root dir)))
    (and root (cons 'transient root))))

(projectile-mode t)

(with-eval-after-load 'project
  (add-to-list 'project-find-functions 'my-projectile-project-find-function))
```

If I now run `(project-current)` in a file inside
`/path/monorepo/project`, I get the correct root path and gopls is
finally happy! Problem solved!
