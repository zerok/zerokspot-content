A couple of months ago I listened to an [interview with Cory
Doctorow](https://craphound.com/news/2018/12/15/talking-dystopia-utopia-science-fiction-and-theories-of-change-on-the-netzpolitik-podcast/)
on the German [Netzpolitik.org](https://netzpolitik.org/podcast/)
podcast in which he described the current state of sci-fi
literature. He also mentioned his most recent sci-fi novel
["Walkaway"](https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/) as an example
of an utopic story contary to all the distopic stories that seem to
have ended up as mainstream over the last couple of years. That piqued
my interest and so I moved it to the very top of my "to-read" list.

The book tells the story of a group of mid-twenties that live in a
world ruled by oligarchs, so-called zottas, in which there are mostly
three kinds of people:

1. The rich (zottas)
2. Those that are in a stable work-relationship with those zottas and
   have basically a decent life but without any real perspective.
3. The majority of people who have on-off jobs and who mostly just
   survive.
   
Coming out of the third kind is a movement called "the walkaways" who
are people having left the safety of the cities and who started to
live their lifes based on their own rules inside a loose
cooperative society.

Over the course of the book, you learn how the walkaways work but also
of the zottas' fear that the walkaways could pose a threat to their
power. The main reason for that is that there are some of the
brightest scientific minds of the human race among the walkaways
who've started working on, among other things, the digitalization of
the human mind and therefore immortality.

It is quite rare that I give a book a 5/5 on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30199375-walkaway) but
this one definitely deserved it. The stories around our particular
walkaway-group are thrilling and well told. There is basically not a
single page that comes even close to be boring and the world that Cory
Doctorow built here is so full of positive energy, it's hard not to
fall in love with it. Concidentally, I was also at Europe's largest
Free- and OpenSource gathering FOSDEM when I read this which boosted
that love for cooperative environments.
