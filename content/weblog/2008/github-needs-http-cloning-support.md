title: GitHub needs HTTP cloning support
---


One of the big disadvantages that [GitHub](http://github.com/) has over for instance [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/) is that there is no way to clone a repository over HTTP. The service is currently limited to cloning via git:// which is quite a problem if you're living behind for instance a corporate firewall. 

There already is a [ticket](http://logicalawesome.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8570/tickets/9-http-clone-url) associated with this problem on GitHub's Lighthouseapp project page, where defunct wrote:

> I'm going to close this until more people ask for it. We plan to start keep track of clone stats so git-daemon is actually preferable. 

So please everyone, vote for this ticket.
