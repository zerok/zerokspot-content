<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/2285894687/" title="Xbox 360 Scattered without Frame by zeroK, on Flickr" class="left"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2234/2285894687_2af396b0c4_m.jpg" width="240" height="178" alt="Xbox 360 Scattered without Frame" /></a>A few hours ago, Heather Champ of [Flickr](http://flickr.com) made [this](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/02/23/scattered-images/) post on the official Flickr blog and introduced me to something that I absolutely want to give a try: *Scattered Images*. That's basically a single image composed of tons of other images (all of the same object or scene) but thanks to different weather, light conditions or camera settings it looks like a mosaik (or in some cases as if seen through a crystal). On the left side you can see my own first attempt with this (sorry, had nothing better within reach right now :P).

For some examples, check out Rob Birze's [astonishing collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rob_birze/sets/72157594152043528/).
