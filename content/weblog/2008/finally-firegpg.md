title: Finally FireGPG

<img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081129-xf34xmsmqb86yyk3tw23wdkcyq.png" class="left" alt="" />[GnuPG](http://gnupg.org/) is a great thing if you have some mails or data that should be shared confidentially and I used to love [Enigmail](http://enigmail.mozdev.org/home/index.php) back when I was still using Thunderbird for all my emailing. But since I've moved exclusively to GMail some months ago, I only rarely used GnuPG anymore since it wasn't as convenient anymore. 

Then I found [FireGPG](http://getfiregpg.org/), an extension for Firefox that helps you sign, encrypt and decrypt text right from your web-browser and even comes with explicit support for the GMail web-frontend. Sadly, for some reason I could never get it to work. It never could find my gpg commandline client even if I told it its exact location. And from what I can tell, I seem [not to be the only one](http://firegpg.tuxfamily.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=122) with this problem. Seems like I always missed the whole "Mac not support" notice, but luckily I gave it a try again today and since FireGPG now supports Intel Macs since version 0.6.2, it finally seems to work :D

There still seems to be a small problem with GnuPG recognizing encrypted messages in GMail, but nothing all that serious.
