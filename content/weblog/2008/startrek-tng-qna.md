title: 'Star Trek TNG: Q & A'
---


<img src="/media/2008/q_and_a.png" alt="" class="left" />One of the longest story-lines in the Star Trek universe is definitely
the one about those almighty beings called the Q. They, together with their
most well known representative Q (portraid by John de Lancie), had their first
appearance right in the first episode of the second Star Trek show: *Star Trek:
The Next Generation* and since then appeared in not only a couple of other
TNG-episodes (including the last one) but also in *DS9* and *Voyager*. With [Q & A](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416527419/) Keith R.A. DeCandido extends the world surrounding the Q Continuum
with another story that brings Q again down onto Captain Picard and the crew
of the Enterprise to finally explain some things.

-------------------------------

The story is set shortly after the TNG-book *Resistance* and the reader, according to the 
trend *Death in Winter* and *Resistance* started, gets to know a whole lot
of new people that should accompany the old crew on finally getting back to
what Starfleet is all about (although it was missing for the most part after 
the first seasons of DS9): exploring the universe. But right when the
Enterprise-crew is about to get on with the whole exploring-thing, Q appears
and starts talking about the end of the universe etc.

First to the good things: As I've mentioned above, this book introduces again
some new characters (replacing those that were killed in *Resistance*) which
is normally a dangerous thing to do, but I'm really glad to say, that the new
characters feel like good additions to the already known crew, with Zelik Leybenzon being a war
veteran who got field-promoted to an officer although he personally doesn't
really like officers, and Miranda Kadohata being chosen by Data himself as
a replacement for him back when he was supposed to be the Enterprise's new
first officer. In general the whole interaction between the characters was
great, esp. with Q, acting as the always annoyed and never 
understood omnipotent being who just wants to have some diversion while still
doing everything to save the universe. 

The whole story was actually quite 
good, but for my taste involved perhaps a bit too many flashbacks. Given
that Q experience time different than us merely mortals, it's not really
a problem that most of the background story of the whole Q vs. Picard-thing
is explained using flashbacks, but still ... well, actually the book's plot
that takes place in the "now" is more or less just the end of the other big
story told here. Just so much: Naturally, it's all about Q ;-)

There were also some guest appearances
by Will Riker, Admiral Shelby and Admiral Janeway which at least didn't felt
as ... annoying (yet still unnecessary except for Janeways and unnecessary) 
compared to those in *Death in Winter*. Perhaps just letting completely random
people make those appearances would help making the whole ST-universe appear
bigger than how it fells right now.

What should make up for all these flashbacks (in case you don't like them),
is the whole character development
involving the new characters as well as little things like how Geordi deals
with the loss of Data (doesn't fit in with some stores in *Strange New Worlds X*, but anyway).
