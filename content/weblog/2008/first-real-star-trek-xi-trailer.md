title: First real Star Trek XI-trailer
---


Seems like the [first *real* trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WNPb8R-40) for Star Trek XI is out. [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5088285/new-star-trek-trailer-bootlegged) has a link to a bootlegged version that seems to have been shown in the pre-program of the latest 007 movie. And honestly? This is the first trailer (or *anything* in general) that makes me want to watch this movie. I'm still not sure, how much confusion this will cause in the timeline, but at least it seems to be quite action-focused. Judging from the trailer, though, it will be quite hard to sell this as a real Star Trek movie.
