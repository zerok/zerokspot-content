title: My Social Software Graph
---


It's been quite some time since I participated in the last meme, but the whole [social software graph](http://arthurkoziel.com/2008/11/23/social-software-graph/) [idea](http://www.amk.ca/diary/2008/11/graph_of_my_social_software.html) was just to tempting. The graph as you see it represents the connection between all the social services I'm using right now. The arrow means "references". Sorry for the mess, but that's the story of my internet-life ;-)

Big thanks to [Arthur](http://arthurkoziel.com/) for pointing me to [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net/). This is a really amazing tool.
