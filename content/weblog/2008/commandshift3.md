<img src="/media/2008/commandshift3.png" alt="" class="left" />Every now and then I come across a site that really makes me come back
every other minute. So happened 2 days ago with [CommandShift3.com](http://commandshift3.com).
If you don't know it yet, CommandShift3 is basically Hot-or-Not for websites. The
frontpage is dominated by 2 large screenshots of 2 websites and you vote
for one of them by simply clicking the screenshot ... and wonder what weird
taste other people have ;-)

-------------------------------

It's esp. addictive if your own website in the pool :-) You can also check
how well your site (or any submitted site for that matter) is faring so far
and also post a short comment. CommandShift3 is also great when you are *not*
a designer and want to find some aspects of your site's look that you could
improve. Just take a look at the other sites in the pool (which you see
a lot anyway if you are addicted to voting there) and esp. the sites that
beat you in battles. You can see the first changes motivated by this 
competition since yesterday ;-)

While you're at it, don't forget to also visit their [about page](http://commandshift3.com/about.html) ;-)
