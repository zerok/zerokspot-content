title: 'BarCamp Senza Confini: I can''t wait!'
---


So next weekend Klagenfurt will see [its 2nd BarCamp](http://www.barcamp.at/BarCamp_Senza_Confini_2008) ever and once again it
will be held in the rooms of the [University of Klagenfurt](http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/) and hopefully help
people in Carinthia to get to know some new topics and 
exchange opinions in a comfortable and amicable atmosphere.

-------------------------------

As in Vienna last September also this time I want to give at least one 
entry-level presentation. Currently I'm still undecided on the topic, though.
Originally I had planned to initiate a discussion about how people use
version control systems. The idea was, to introduce new people to this topic
who've never worked or even heard of such systems and show them how much
easier their life can be with them. The problem with this though: I currently
lack the time to do a sophisticated inquiry in this area, so at best
I could drop in my personal opinion. 

The second topic, which is becoming more and more my primary one, is "CSS
Frameworks". Here, I have less experience but I currently investigating some 
for a couple of projects of mine; so I'm currently more into them compared to 
VCS. Here I at least plan to take a look at at least 2 frameworks and 
give a short overview of what the advantages and disadvantages of them and
CSS frameworks in general are. Well, that's for the plan. Let's see if I can
find enough time tomorrow and next week (moving to a different office, skiing,
other BarCamp preparations ...) for at least one of these topics.
