title: Last preparations for PyCon UK
---


Well, tomorrow it's finally time for me to depart to the UK. After, I guess, around 15 years, I've finally found with this years [PyCon UK](http://pyconuk.org) an excuse to get up there again. Flights are booked, stuff nearly packed. Now all I have to manage is getting to the airport in time and getting a train when arriving at Stansted ;-) The first part is easy but I have absolutely no clue how part 2 will work out. I really hope that it will be as easy as getting a train from Amsterdam Airport to Amsterdam Central 3 years ago ;-) At least according to the [Cross Country website](http://www.crosscountry.trainsfares.co.uk) there is a direct connection departing at 19:16 from Stansted Airport which hopefully won't be extremely expensive :-(

I'm really excited to be at the event this weekend with people like Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Simon Willison et al. giving Django-talks, Chris Withers explaining why [Python Package Management sucks](http://pyconuk.org/talk_abstracts.html#55) and much more. There will even be a [Photo Competition](http://www.pyconuk.org/community/PhotoCompetition2008) held during the con. I've also planed to spend most of Friday for some sightseeing. Especially the [ThinkTank](http://www.thinktank.ac/) and the [Bothanical Gardens](http://www.birminghambotanicalgardens.org.uk/) look like great places (to also take some great pictures at) :D The rest of the day should probably be spent finding my way around Birmingham as well as already showing up at the registration desk and taking a look at the local DVD stores ;-) Let's see, depending on how much fish'n chips I can take I might even spend the evening out, now that I've seen [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewdunn/2423310340/) ... I guess I really need more SD-Cards.
