title: I hate contact spam
---


It's weird, everywhere you go on the net, you get spammed in one fashion or another. Websites, e-mail, etc. Not even IM is an exception mostly with porn spam ... nor is [twitter](http://twitter.com). During the last couple of days I got 3 followers that all looked very ebay'ish to me: Meaning they looked like sellers on ebay that wanted to promote stuff. 

What I don't get with this kind of spam, is the point. I mean, this only really works if you auto-follow people, which is a bad idea to begin with. I guess, auto-blocking people who want to follow you and have posted recently something about ebay or anything else that makes them appear to be contact-spammers would be nice ;-)
