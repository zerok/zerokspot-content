title: Bye Bye Pownce
---


It's always sad to see services that you actually really liked going the way of the dodo. It just happened a few days ago with Stikkit and now it's [Pownce's time to leave the net](http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/). I personally never found a real use-case for me with Pownce but I always liked the service nonetheless for it's quite unique approach to social messaging. Now that [Leah](http://leahculver.vox.com/) and [Mike](http://mjmalone.vox.com/) [move on to SixApart](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2008/12/welcome-pownce-team.html), Pownce will be shut down (but at least with a 14 days time-period for getting your data out of it). 

What I don't get about this whole move is, that why SixApart is hiring both of them. From what I've gathered, SixApart seems to me like a pure Perl-shop while Pownce was (and for the next 2 weeks still is) a pure Django application. It's also definitely sad to see one of the biggest (or least most popular) Django sites go down. 

Anyway: Big thanks to Leah and Mike for Pownce and good luck with SixApart :-) (Perhaps you can teach them some serious programming language over there ;-) j/k). The whole story has one positive aspect, though: I finally can focus exclusively on Twitter for social messaging ;-)
