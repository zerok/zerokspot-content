title: 'Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction'
---


I love Ratchet & Clank. I really do. So far I've played every single game of the franchise (except for [Secret Agent Clank](http://www.giantbomb.com/secret-agent-clank/61-21000/) and the new PSN title [Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty](http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-future-quest-for-booty/61-21115/)) and absolutely loved every single one of them. The first installment of the franchise on the Playstation 3, [Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction](http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-future-tools-of-destruction/61-15212/) is no exception there ... at least for the most part. 

-------------------------------

It offers basically everything you've come to expect from the series including humor, jump'n'gun action and great weapons. If you liked any other game of the series, you will definitely enjoy this one, but be warned: While graphically miles above the other games, it's not really a revolution but "just" an evolution. Also it feels definitely shorter than the PS2-installments and esp. [Going Commando](http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-going-commando/61-4618/) and [Up Your Arsenal](http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-up-your-arsenal/61-4966/). There is nartually again an arena with your usual battles against wave after wave of enemies, but there is no big open area like the desert in "Going Commando" and the ice plain and sewers in "Up your Arsenal".

In general the game feels more like a successor to the PSP-title [Size Matters](http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-size-matters/61-8837/) than anything else. No vehicle action, only very simplified space-action (Starfox instead of Wing Commander), no 2D levels with Capt. Quark, not even some fist-fighting with Giant Clank. All you get is jumping and shooting with the well known leveling system (although also simplified). Still, the controls are great once again, the graphics are really nice and the cutscenes are just hilarious. The game even has a story and you finally learn something about the Lombax.
