<img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080829-8s6pd4kbu4hmcbd6whdt44k23h.png" alt="" class="left" />Just a short "Congrats" to the jQuery team for the [redesign](http://jquery.com/blog/2008/08/29/jquerycom-site-redesign/) of [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com). The old design got quite ... well, old after all this time ;-)  In general, the new design looks like a complete reboot: New color-scheme, new logo, new feel and all great in my opinion. The new narrow design really helps me focus on the actual content of the site, esp. in the documentation section which (although structurally identical from what I can see) feels much lighter and easier to look at. Only the whole "Be a Javascript Rock Star" is kind of weird and definitely addresses the wrong audience (script kiddies). There is actually already a [huge discussion](http://jquery.com/blog/2008/08/29/jquery-site-redesign-the-community-speaks/) about this on the jQuery blog. 

**Update:** [Now also for people who don't want to be rock stars](http://jquery.com/blog/2008/08/29/death-to-javascript-rock-stars/). Thanks :-)
