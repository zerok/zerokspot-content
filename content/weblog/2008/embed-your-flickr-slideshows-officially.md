title: Embed your Flickr slideshows ... officially
---


Just last monday the question came up how do you actually embed a bunch of [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) photos into your blog? Back then all I knew was that there was [a well document yet not really official trick](http://paulstamatiou.com/2005/11/19/how-to-quickie-embedded-flickr-slideshows) which basically gave you the slideshow in an iframe. Since this was obviously too complicated for some people, [flickrslidr.com](http://flickrslidr.com/) appeared on the net.

Today [Flickr itself finally announced an official way](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/08/20/new-slideshow/) to embed a slideshow which thankfully doesn't use an iframe ;-) For this you can now find a new "share" link whenever you're watching a slideshow. 

<div class="figure"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080821-jwb4dj7ur4n4khn6m8uq99j58m.png" alt="" /><p class="caption">Embed your slideshows (with options)</p></div>

If you don't want the default size, just follow the "Customize this HTML" link indicated in the screenshot above and you get to a simple form for doing just that.
