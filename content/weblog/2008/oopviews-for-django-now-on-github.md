title: OOP Views for Django now on GitHub
---


About a week ago I [wrote](/weblog/1037/) about bringing some OOP into Django views and also posted some code for that. Since I use this in one project and want to move it also into some other project of mine, I've put this (together with some very simple pagination templatetag) into its own pluggable app and uploaded it github for everybody to slap me around for my coding style ;-)

So if you want to use this code, simply install the app available [here](http://github.com/zerok/django-zsutils/tree/master) (or just import the [django_zsutils.utils.oopviews](http://github.com/zerok/django-zsutils/tree/master/utils/oopviews.py) module).
