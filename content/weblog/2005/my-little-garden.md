title: My little garden

Just some little updates on my own little <a href="http://www.zerokspot.com/csszengarden/">CSS zen garden</a>: I've removed the dummy design entries in the design list and replaced it with the actual listing of available designs. Since I plan to add more of my not-really-good-looking designs I thought this was a good idea to spent some minutes on ;-) Since I'm kind of a winter fanatic I will probably add one more winter design here. Perhaps it will be based on this really <a href="http://sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&id=121560">great winter-sunset photo</a> by <a href="http://sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=profile&l=stryjek4">stryjek4</a>. Let's see ;-)
