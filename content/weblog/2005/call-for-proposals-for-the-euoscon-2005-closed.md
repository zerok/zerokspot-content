title: Call for proposals for the EUOSCON 2005 closed
---


If you wanted to make a presentation proposal for the EUOSCON 2005 I hope you already did it, otherwise it's too late. Seems like this conference will be quite programming language centric...  exactly what I've been waiting for :-) To bad that I have to make a trip to the Netherlands to get something like this, but I enjoyed my last vacation in Amsterdam anyway ;-) According to the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/create/e_sess">current conference page</a> registration will be opened somewhen in July. To bad. I wished the could already give some more details in June so that I can start booking flights, getting train tickets etc. I just hope that I'll still get a hotel room for that week :-?
