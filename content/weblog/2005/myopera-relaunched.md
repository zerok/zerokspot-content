---


At 1200CEST Opera Software finally launched the new version of their community portal my.opera.com which comes with a fresh new look and some nice new features. Since I can't compare it to the old version I will simply list some features that caught my eye:

-------------------------------



* Weblog with Trackback, Atom, RSS and MetaweblogAPI support

* Image gallery

* Weblog and Gallery support tagging

* Links collection

* New forum software



Really nice for a community portal IMO :)
