Originally I planned to give FeedBurner a try after reading <a href="">this article</a> on stopdesign. The benefits for me would be to reduce the bandwidth used by serving the feets and also to get some quite detailed statistics on if anyone reads them at all ;-)

-------------------------------



So what happened to this plan? It was moved back at least for 1 day. Today (and eventually tomorrow) I have an exam to worry about and I'm still to focused on Flickr to currently find some time for other activities in my free time ;-) Tomorrow in the afternoon there is also the opening party of the Lakeside Park in Klagenfurt (where I spent my working hours ;-) ) and I want to at least take some photos there :-) As I said, I'm currently a little bit flickrized ;-)



So, if I find some time tomorrow evening I will probably start exploring FeedBurner after registering an account today. The only thing that makes me think again about this all is the time-out problem quite a few people have mentioned <a href="http://workboxers.com/webmaster_tools/feedburner_review.php">here</a>. I also have some FeedBurner-served feeds in my list but never really experienced this problem. Another thing, that irritates me a little bit is the commercial aspect of FeedBurner. Besides offering free accounts, there seem to be also paid accounts with extra features. The problem I have with this is.... that I couldn't find a feature list showing what's in the basic account plan and what's in the paid account plan ;-)
