This night WordPress 1.5 has been released... yeah... what else should I write here? I mean.... there are far too many good articles about there that already describe in detail what's hot and now about this new versions...

Ah and zeroKspot.com is already running on WordPress 1.5 stable ;-) The update was really easy. Just replace your old files and run the wp-admin/upgrade.php. There I got a warning about a problem in the wp-settings.php which seems not to be really a problem at all :-)



Congratulations to the whole WordPress team :-)
