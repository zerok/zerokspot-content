title: Google blogsearch beta
---


Google has now opened the doors for a beta version of their Blog search engine. It definitely looks like Google and is fast like Google but (according to the <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2005/09/14/google-blog-search-reviewed/">Blog Herald</a>) they only have around 9 million sites weblogs indexed which is IMO quite disappointing. For me personally the only advantage that the new google blog search has is its speed. If Technorati wasn't so damn slow, there would be absolutely no need for alternatives (apart from information monopolism ;) ).

-------------------------------



I really hope that when this new service comes out of beta it will offer at least some of the blog specific features offered by sites like blogpulse or technorati, otherwise this service would be totally redundant :-?
