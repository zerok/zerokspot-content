title: Readers? Thanks you all :D
---


First of all I want to say "Thank you" to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">Michael Arrington</a> for speaking up and letting me know, that there are really some people reading my weblog :-) I hope it is at least partially usable and interesting :-) This also made me check my feedburner statistics and it said something about 15 circulations per day... Hell, this also indicates that there are more people than just <a href="http://www.leftontheweb.com/">Stefan</a> and me visiting zerokspot.com ... Thanks Stefan by the way :)

But this also made me start to think again: Do I really want to change the fundaments of zerokspot by changing its primary language? Well, now I'm in a small dilemma: It's much easier for me to express myself and my thoughts in my mother tongue but with English much more people would be able to read these thoughts. Is there a middle way? Well, non that are good enough for me, at least as far as I can tell. I'll try to make a decision by tonight and let you know about it :) ... But honestly: Do you really want to endure my weak english stills?
