title: Firefox 1.5 RC1
---


With a few hours delay the first release candidate of Firefox 1.5 has now finally been released :) Hell, it's even so new, that there are still some old references to Beta2 on the Mozilla.org site ;) If you're using one of the later nightly builds (for example from Oct. 25th) you won't get an update notification so you have to download and install it manually. Perhaps a build-date based check as an addition to the version check would have been nice ;)

-------------------------------



Ok, another reason for the not-triggered auto update is perhaps that the build was actually made on Oct 25th ;)
