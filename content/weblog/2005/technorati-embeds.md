<a href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/06/23.html">Technorati has now released the new Embeds Javascript</a> which you can include in your weblog if you've claimed your weblog. IIRC previously the whole script only produces a link to your profile. Now you can configure it to also include a small search box and a referrers link :-) If you've wondered what this "Technorati" box in the menu here is: That's it ;-) For now I've only tried the search box which seems to work quite well.

-------------------------------



Here I have a small feature request ;-) I'm most of the time blogging adding Technorati tags to my posts. It would be nice if the search resultset on Technorati would also list the tags that have been assoziated with the matching posts :-)
