title: 2.6.10 now with keyboard *g*
---


Well, more or less. During the release candidate phase of the Linux kernel 2.6.10 I had some problems with the keyboard drivers (probably caused by some power management drivers) resulting in a box without working keyboard after booting one of these kernels. Seems like all problems have been fixed in the final version :-)
