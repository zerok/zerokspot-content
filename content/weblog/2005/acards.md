For all of you who still think that there are not enough Flash-memory standards out there: There is a now one on the block. It's called ÂµCard and should be compatible with SD- and MMC-Cards. Heise.de wrote, that this medium should be cheaper than the current SD- and MMC-cards which will definitely make my digicam happy ;-)

-------------------------------



Another nice feature is the planned maximum capacity of these new cards: 2 TeraByte :-)



You can find more information about this new standard on <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/55612">heise.de</a> (german).
