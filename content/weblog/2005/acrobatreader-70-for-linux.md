title: AcrobatReader 7.0 for Linux
---


It's nearly unbelieveable but Adobe has finally released v7 of their Reader software for Linux. After testing it with 2 small PDFs I have to say, that it looks quite good and is also IMO faster than the 5.x series. The only thing, that really annoys me, is that I always get a warning, that there was a problem with the PPKLite.api plugin during the startup.

-------------------------------



At least strange is the size of the package: Nearly 40MB :-?
