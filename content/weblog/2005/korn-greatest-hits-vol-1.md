title: KoRn - Greatest Hits Vol. 1
---


<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/gallery/image.php?id=55&action=viewthumb" class="left" alt="Album cover"/>After adding some CDs to my music collection last week I want to write at least a short review about one of them: The first greatest hits collection of KoRn. I only have 2 albums of KoRn before getting this collection but I really came to like this band because of their quite unique style of Rock and also because of Jonathan Davis' vocals. 

-------------------------------



The CD has tracks from the last 10 years of KoRn including master pieces like <cite>Freak on a Leash</cite> and <cite>Right now</cite>. But if you think that this album only includes songs you already have in your collection, think again ;-) "Greatest Hits Vol. 1" also includes two new tracks:

* <cite>Word Up!</cite>
* <cite>Another Brick in the Wall</cite>

Both of them are covers but sound really great. I actually bought this album because of <cite>Word Up!</cite> after hearing a preview of it on Amazon.

After hearing it a few times I also really like <cite>Alone I break</cite> which IMO doesn't really sound like your usual KoRn-song but feels somehow much more ... atmospherical. I can't really write much about the other tracks since I hadn't a lot of time listening to them yet or already know them from other albums I have (<cite>Y'all want a single</cite>, <cite>Did my time</cite>, <cite>Make me bad</cite> and <cite>Falling away from me</cite>, which I really love).

The album also comes with a DVD that includes videos of some live performance. Sorry, had no time to what them yet :-(

So if you haven't enough KoRn in your music collection yet, get this album ... or at least first check out the track-previews for example on amazon :-)
