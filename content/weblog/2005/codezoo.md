With <a href="http://www.codezoo.net">CodeZoo</a> O'Reilly has launched some kind of Software component repository for software components that can be freely reused, or to say write in their words:

-------------------------------

<blockquote cite="http://www.codezoo.net/news.csp">CodeZoo exists to help you find high-quality, freely available, reusable components, getting you past the repetitive parts of coding, and onto the rest and the best of your projects. </blockquote>



Additional to just offer the download CodeZoo also offers forms to let users exchange tips and reviews about a given component. There are also always links to related O'Reilly books on the component pages ;-)



The site currently only offers Java code but using the "Feedback" form you're asked to suggest additional languages. I'd really love to see some C, C++ or Python components ;-)
