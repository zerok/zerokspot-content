title: Flickr up and running again?

Seems like the bug with API keys on flickr has finally been fixed after being a problem to probably hundreds of people for the better part of the day :-) It's also quite a good timing since I forgot to bookmark the workaround-organizer-link anyway. Now I'm just waiting for some post on the official weblog giving some details about what happened :-)
