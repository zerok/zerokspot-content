title: Registering a not existing trademark as username ...
---


There are strange things and there are stupid things... and sometimes there are strange stupid things. For example in the german weblogging scene there are now quite some articles about the forum <a href="http://www.ironsport.de/">ironsport.de</a> where a user registered using a nickname that is a registered trademark by some company [<a href="http://ironsport.de/klage_gegen_forum.html">link</a>]... at least that's what some lawyer claimed. As prove were simple google listings used which basically included the indexed forum posts of the user \*g\* The admin of that forum got exactly 3 days time to sign a declararation of omission (I hope this is the right term ;-) ), pay more than 5000EUR and remove the user and all references to the name from his board.

Today the lawyer of Patrick Albers (admin of ironsports.de) Dr. Martin Bahr shot them a really nice and quite aggressive <a href="http://ironsport.de/klage_gegen_forum2.html">response</a> in which he takes the charges apart.
