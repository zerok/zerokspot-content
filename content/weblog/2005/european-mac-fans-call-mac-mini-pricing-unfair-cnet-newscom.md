title: European Mac fans call Mac Mini pricing unfair | CNET News.com

Seems like some other people have noticed it too, that the Mac Mini will be much more expensive here in Europe than on the other side of the Atlantic ocean. While I know about the tax difference it would still probably help Apple's case more, if they'd make some kind of introduction offer, where the tax is "ignored" so that all people pay exactly the same for their new Mac Mini. This would really boost the whole thing a lot.

Just for those out there, that don't know about the price difference I will list the prices of the small edition here (as far as I know them):

* USA: 499USD

* Germany: 489EUR

* Austria: 499EUR
