title: Snow anyone?
---


Bah,  Dan Cederholm did it again.... <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/02/13/ski.html">He posted another winter picture... </a> It really sucks if you live in a country where you normally get tons of snow and ice and everyone around you outside of a radius of about 100km has snow... except you. Northern Austria, Germany, all these regions don't know what to do with all the snow they get (infact they seem to get also our share of snow this year *g* ), but in Carinthia (southern Austria) or at least in Klagenfurt (captical of Carinthia) we had no snow or rain or whatever since mid-december :-(
