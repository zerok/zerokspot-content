---


Davyd Madeley has once again wrote a small intro into the upcoming Gnome release. This time it's all about the changes in Gnome 2.10. Among the new or revised features in Gnome 2.10 that are presented here are things like the new menu system, the improved help browser Yelp and the features in the Gnome text editor GEdit, which now for example supports the highlighting of the current line.
