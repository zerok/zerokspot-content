According to MozillaZine Doug Turner has confirmed the development of a Windows CE version of the Minimo project. A Gecko based browser on Windows CE would really be great because the other browsers I've seen so far weren't really impressive. JavaScript dying on the first sight of DOM in the Windows Mobile edition of Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera only being available for Windows Mobile on Smartphones etc. Minimo could really rock this whole platform :-)
