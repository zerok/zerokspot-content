title: Window Mobile 2003 SE and ClearType?
---


Hmm.... while working here with a Dell Axim X30 I've noticed something quite strange: In Windows Mobile you can make the whole Touchscreen thing work in landscape mode. Nice. But there is one problem: Normally you can enable the ClearType font rendering in Windows Mobile 2003 SE which gives you quite nice antialiased fonts and so on. Not so in landscape mode, which is quite annoying IMO.

Has anyone perhaps made some similiar experiences with Windows Mobile 2003 out there?
