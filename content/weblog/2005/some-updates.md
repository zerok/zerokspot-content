title: Some updates
---


Today I've used part of my day-off-because-of-being-ill time to get some changes done here which were partially lost during the update to zs-2.5. 

-------------------------------



<ul>

<li>Some categories will from now on have some specific banners. I started with the movies/tv section today and will probably also add specific banners to the various software and development sections. After quite a few hours of stupid bug hunting I finally got the little hacky code working after noticing that I've accidently overwritten some global variables that are used by some internal wordpress functions *g*</li>

<li>I also added the "quicklinks" section were I link to my link-repositories on sites like <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. While I also list my spurl and furl archives I basically only really use the del.icio.us service because its simplicity and really good community-facilities. Perhaps I'll write the 1001st article on the web about all these services later on :-) </li>

</ul>
