title: Mono 1.1.4 and 1.0.6
---


Today the Mono Project released two new revisions of the two supported branches of their .NET implementation. They also recommend that everyone who can should switch to the 1.1.x branch since it should be more stable, faster and have less bugs. 

-------------------------------



The announcement can be read <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/news/index.html2-2f17-2f2005-202-3a00-3a00-20PM">here</a> which also includes links to the release notes of both releases.



To bad, Gentoo still only has the 1.0.x branch in portage :-( I know, I know, I'm a version-junkie *g*
