title: My.Opera.com problems?
---


Is perhaps Opera Software having some problems with their community servers? Since a few hours half of my requests result in white pages or return code 500 error messages or simple nice messages like this:

-------------------------------



<blockquote><pre>Bad Gateway



The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.



Apache Server at my.opera.com Port 80</pre></blockquote>



Perhaps they didn't expect <strong>that</strong> many new people interested in the browser now that it has gone free ;-) I just hope that they will fix this problem soon, otherwise the whole marketing bonus will get lost after the 3rd click of their users ;-)
