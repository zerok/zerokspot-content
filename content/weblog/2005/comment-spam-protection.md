title: Comment spam protection

Because this weblog has been hit quite hard during the last day with spam I've installed <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/wordpress/wp-gatekeeper.html">Eric Meyer's Gatekeeper plugin</a> here. If anyone of you has a problem commenting on for example this post, please drop me a mail at tehzerok [aT] gmail [d0t] com :)

-------------------------------



If it works I will also install it on gamerslog.com, but for the time being, commenting will stay disabled there.
