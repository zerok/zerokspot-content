title: NP_TechnoratiTags moves to a new stable
---


<a href="http://edmondhui.homeip.net/blog">Admun</a> has volunteered to be the new maintainer/developer of the NP\_TechnoratiTags plugin. He already made a <a title="NP_TechnoratiTags-0.4" href="http://edmondhui.homeip.net/nudn/item/636">new release</a> fixing some things. Since I'm not using Nucleus and only developed the plugin to get to know the plugin system and API of Nucleus this was probably the best thing that could happen to NP\_TechnoratiTags :-) 

-------------------------------



First of all I want to say thank you to Admun for further developing and maintaining this plugin and I also wan to apologize for the long time it took me to make this post. The last week was quite heavy-going.
