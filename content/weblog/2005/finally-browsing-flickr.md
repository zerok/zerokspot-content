title: Finally browsing flickr...
---


... well, ehm.... I really had problems browsing flickr until now. Firefox always crashed when loading the flash part of every photo page so I always had Opera open when I wanted to view some flickr photos. Today I tried to install Firefox from source just to see if it solves this problem for me. Nope. Then I just wanted to check what version of Flash Firefox was using and there it was: There was somewhere still an old version ... or better ancient version of a flash plugin installed somewhere. It wasn't installed through Gentoo's portage so I must have installed it manually.

-------------------------------



So I went to check the ~/.mozilla/plugins folder and there I found some old flash plugin files :-? After removing them and restarting Firefox I could also finally access flickr. I'm perhaps really far too stupid for all of this :-(
