Nope. But even then, a search engine with a new idea is always nice :-) Marsflag is a site like this. The japanese search site seems to focus on japanese sites but comes with a really nice idea for presenting its results: With small screenshots of each hit which zooms it a little bit when you hover it. I couldn't yet find out, the reason for calling such a site "Marsflag" and putting a small doggy right next to its logo, but who really cares anyway? ;)

P.S.: Sorry, I was quite lazy to upload the screenshot to my own webspace so I've given imageshack a try today :) .... Could it be that images2share and imageshack are one and the same company?
