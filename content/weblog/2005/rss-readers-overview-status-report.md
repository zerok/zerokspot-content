title: RSS Readers overview status report
---


As I've written in a previous post I'm currently working on a small overview of RSS readers similiar to the weblog software available on <a href="http://unblogbar.com/software/">unblogbar.com</a>. I want to officially announce it when I've reached 10 readers in the list (otherwise it simply looks way to empty for my taste ;) ). Currently following readers are in my list

-------------------------------



* Liferea (Linux)

* Bloglines (Web)

* Rojo (Web)

* Side4 (Web)

* Pluck (Web)

* Feedmarker (Web)



As you can see I've also included a Linux client and will probably add also some Java clients, but I can't test Windows or MacOS clients simply because I don't have any of these operating systems at my disposal. I'm currently also looking for further suggestions as to what other readers I should test :)
