title: Rechargeable batteries pricing...
---


Yesterday I wanted to get some rechargeable batteries for my iAudio G3 ... I'm still happy that I got out of the shop without running around screaming *g* The pricing is IMO ridiculous. The rechargeables are not really the problem here, but the charger. The cheapest Duracell charger costs nearly 40EUR. They batteries themselves only 18EUR (4 rechargeables). If the charger would be available for let's say 20EUR I would have bought it right away, but not for 40EUR ...
