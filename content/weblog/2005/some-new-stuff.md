title: Some new stuff ;-)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/15795777/" class="left" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos10.flickr.com/15795777_008d50982b_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Strange case :-?" /></a> Finally some new music and a new book :-) The new CD in my collection is Nine Inch Nails - <cite>The downward spiral</cite> and the new book is <cite>Star Trek: Engines of Destiny</cite>.

-------------------------------



Sure, the CD is far from being new (1994), but after listening to <cite>With teeth</cite> for ... 2 weeks(?) I thought about getting some more music of the Nine Inch Nails and ordered the CD last Sunday on Amazon since it wasn't really expensive. This time it even has a booklet, but the rest of the case is IMO really strange. The CD itself comes in a cheap maxi case and together with the booklet they are wrapped in a cardboard case... strange idea. 



The sound itself is quite timeless. Not completely different from <cite>With teeth</cite> but still much rougher and harder. Let's see what's the next NIN album I'll order ;-)



The book on the other hand is one of the next generation era together with Capt. Scott, Capt. Kirk and Guinan... yupp: <cite>Generations</cite> ;-) I'm currently somewhere around page 100 and it's really good :-) But I'll perhaps write more about it later in another post :-) My problem with books of this kind is that I simply read them to fast ... and often so that I barely get any work done as long as I haven't finished the book :-)
