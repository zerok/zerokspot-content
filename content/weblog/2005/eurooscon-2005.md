Besides well known events like the Web 2.0 conference or Where 2.0 O'Reilly will also host a european version of the Open Source Conference in Amsterdam this october. Since I always wanted to attend such a conference (and I now stopped searching for excuses not to do so) I'm very excited about it :-) I already started to look for a cheap flight ticket there as well as accommodation. After checking the pricing on some airlines I'm more concerned with the flight than the hotel room... I for example saw some pricing around 330EUR economy class ... ey, that's an IPAQ. Next I will check the pricing on going by train. Hopefully this will be more effordable for me.

To bad I haven't found any details yet about where exactly in Amsterdam the OSCON will take place. I guess I will simply have to wait until O'Reilly announces more details :-) For now, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/create/e_sess">this</a> seems to be the only official information about the conference :-(
