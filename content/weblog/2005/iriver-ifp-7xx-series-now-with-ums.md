title: iRiver iFP-7xx series now with UMS
---


iRiver has released UMS drivers for their iFP-7xx series. Ok, this happened a few weeks back but I only found out thanks to <a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/archives/003687.html">this article on geeknewscentral</a>. This came as a small shock because I've ordered an iAudio G3 just yesterday which is much more expensive then the comparable model by iRiver (iFP-799). With this new firmware it should be no problem to get the player receive it's music also from GNU/Linux systems instead of the proprietary software iRiver bundles with its product :-)

-------------------------------



Now I just hope that I can cancel my order and that the player can really be simply mounted after the firmware upgrade :-)
