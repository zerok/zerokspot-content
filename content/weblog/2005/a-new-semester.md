title: A new semester
---


Tomorrow is the beginning of a the new semester here at the University of Klagenfurt which also means that perhaps I will have less time writing here. Besides studying I also have a more or less full-time job until end of April and after that probably a half-time job. Could become quite stressy :-)

-------------------------------



I will still try to post at least once every day but perhaps it will just sometimes end with a del.icio.us post :-( Let's see :-)



My courses this time are:



* System security

* Database technologies

* Operations research 1 (once again \*g\*)

* Object oriented implementation of algorithms and data structures

* "Grenzen des Formalen" (I don't really know what this course is all about but it sounds quite philosophical :-) )



... so expect to see many links (and hopefully also some posts) about this topic in the months to come :-)
