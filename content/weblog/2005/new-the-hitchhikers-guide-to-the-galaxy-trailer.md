title: New "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" trailer
---


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/103-3543107-5086218">A new trailer of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is now available on amazon.com</a> :-) I've never read the book, but the movie seems to be quite funny. I just wish, the trailer would be available in a higher resolution. 320 x 128 isn't really all that great :-(
