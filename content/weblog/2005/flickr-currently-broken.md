title: Flickr currently broken :-?
---


Seems like <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> has currently a big problem with their API key management: Nothing works except uploading and viewing images. Settings titles, tags and descriptions currently results in a not so nice error message. At least setting the privacy of images still works :-) When you then hit the OK button to close the error message you even get redirected to the "New Topic" dialog of the FlickrBugs forum ... bad idea *g* Currently the first 5 pages of this forum are full of people posting about this bug. Let's hope that this problem is quickly fixed ... and the bugs forum is cleaned up :P

<h4>Update</h4>

There now seems to be at least a way to get into the organizer where tags, titles and descriptions can be edited. <http://flickr.com/forums/bugs/7188/>
