Seems like each and every app now once again needs its own live cd :) Now its Enlightenment's turn with <a href="http://livecd.debianitas.net/">Elive</a>. IMO given the quite complex installation procedure for the cvs snapshots it's really a nice idea to make a live cd for E* :) Ok, it still doesn't beat compiling and installing Gnome from scratch but anyway ;) Based on Morphix it comes with E16 and E17 so that you can also compare the present and future of the Enlightenment project. If I hadn't E17 already installed on my system I'd probably try it using a Live CD ... if I had any CDRs left ...
