title: A few hours left

In just a few hours to <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot Fall 2005</a> and until I will roll out the new design for zerokspot.com. I'm honestly quite excited since the design is more or less finished for at least a month and I personally really like it. It's definitely the design I put the most time and consideration into.

One small note: I haven't really tested it with Internet Explorer, only with Opera and Firefox, since I don't have a Windows installation at my disposal. But more about this later :)
