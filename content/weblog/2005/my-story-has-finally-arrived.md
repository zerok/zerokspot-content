title: '"My Story" has finally arrived'
---


Today I finally got my copy of Ayumi Hamasaki latest album "My Story" in a bundle with a DVD. Ok, I admit that I don't understand a single word, but I simply love the sound of her music. 

Here are some packshots and I once again have to praise Asian online stores. I've ordered twice now CDs in Asia. The first time about a year back in Hong Kong and this time in Tokyo and both times the really well packed.
