title: del.icio.us keywords for Firefox
---


Ever wanted to make a quickseach in your del.icio.us repository without having to enter the whole tag-URL ( http://del.icio.us/tag/test+test2 ) ? Firefox offers a quite handy little bookmarks feature that let's you enter URLs like "google searchterm" into the addressbar and would forward you to the result page for this search query (if that keyword was bound ;-) )

You can also use this to browse del.icio.us. For example if you want to access specific dpel.icio.us from your personal repository using the "command" (or better keyword) mydel as shown in this example...

... you simply have to make a new bookmark with following settings:

The %s in the URL is then replaced with the string after the command in your addressbar (in our example this would be the vim+gentoo string)

Now happy..... del.icio.using..... whatever
