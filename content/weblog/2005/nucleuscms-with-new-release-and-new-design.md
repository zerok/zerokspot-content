title: NucleusCMS with new release and new design
---


Nucleus is now available in version 3.2 which includes a new default skin, many bugfixes, the <a href="http://wiki.gednet.com/NPSkinFiles">NP_SkinFiles</a> by default, many additions to the plugin API and much more :-) For more details checkout the <a href="http://www.nucleuscms.org/index.php?itemid=3028">announcement on nucleuscms.org</a> :-)

-------------------------------



What does this mean for me? Another reason to give Nucleus once again a try ;-)
