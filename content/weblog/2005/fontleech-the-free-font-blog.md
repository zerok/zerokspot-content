You're looking for nice fonts (for example for your website) but don't have or don't want to spent lots of money to get some of the commercial font packages? Ok, your other option would be to browse the web (or google for) some free fonts. But how to find the quality pearls among them? 

-------------------------------



There is now someone who does the work for you :-) <a href="http://fontleech.com/">Fontleech.com</a> is a weblog about free fonts which was launched just a few days ago and looks really promising :-) So if you're looking for some quality free fonts, then this is IMO quite a good starting point.
