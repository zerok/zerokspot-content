title: EuroOSCON over ... I'm late :(
---


First of all: Sorry, but I wasn't able to post my comments about the last 2 days of the EuroOSCON as promised in my previous post, but I was all the time on the hunt for some handkerchief replacement since I had none left anymore and the air condition nearly killed me :-?

-------------------------------



Anyway: The last 2 days of the EuroOSCON were really great :) In this post I want to comment Wednesday (19th Oct.) while probably my next post will focus on the last day :) For me the best event was the Maker Faire event in the evening, but first things first.



<dl>

<dt>Scaling, Securing and Deploying PHP : Lerdorf</dt><dd><p>Nice presentation by Rasmus Lerdorf with IMO perhaps a little bit too much focus on PHP basics. If you announce a security and deployment focused session IMO you should normally already be able to expect people to know the basics. Just my 2Â¢ :)</p></dd>



<dt>Firefox: Mainstreaming Open Source : Goodger</dt><dd><p>Quite marketing focused where Ben Goodger presented what Firefox and the Mozilla Foundation/Corporation do and have done to make Firefox a buzzword.</p></dd>



<dt>svk: Version Control without the Headaches : Kao</dt><dd><p>subversion+ ? Well, perhaps :) It definitely sounded quite interesting but for my taste Perl applications still have too many module dependencies ;)</p></dd>



<dt>Buildings Apps with Subversion : Stein</dt><dd><p>Puh, using Subversion to manage a Wiki without making external syscalls and things like that. Sweet but very technical.... which isn't bad ;)</p></dd>



<dt>Descriptors, Decorators, Metaclasses: Python's "Black Magic"? : Martelli</dt><dd><p>Hardcore Python ... for my taste a little bit too hardcore since my brain shut off after the first 3 slides ;)</p></dd>



<dt>Shielding and Exposing Innovation : Lefkowitz</dt><dd><p>In my opinion one of the greatest session of the EuroOSCON. Robert M. Lefkowitz explained in a very refreshing the history of innovation and patents. And that being innovation can get you into prison ;)</dd>

As already mentioned, that evening's event was simply great: At the Maker Faire O'Reilly presented some projects published in their Make magazine including really great stuff like <a href="http://promise.tv/">promise.tv</a> - a home gateway / TV solution - and <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> - a virtual realtity where people have more or less every freedom and can for example construct new objects, events etc. using a powerful scripting environment. You can also buy land there ;)



O'Reilly also offered free copies of the current issue of their Make magazine :D ... and finally free beer ;)
