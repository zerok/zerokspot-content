title: Bye bye Mandrake
---


After stopping using MandrakeLinux a few years ago I really don't know a thing about their current products or their current product quality and so on but there's still a special place for Mandrake in my heart since it was my first Linux distribution and I had my best support experience ever with them :-)

-------------------------------



So now it's over. The name "Mandrake" will cease to exist after the fusion with Connectiva. Bye Mandrake and welcome Mandriva. Good luck with the new name :-)
