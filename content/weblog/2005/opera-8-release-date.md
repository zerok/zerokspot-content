title: Opera 8 release date?

Seems like there is now at least an inofficial release date for the next major release of the Opera browser. In <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/commentary/article.php/3496566">commentary</a> Erin Joyce of internetnews.com wrote:

Since she didn't write "a Tuesday" it's IMO quite save to say that she meant <em>this</em> Tuesday.



I really hope that this is true. I've been waiting for the final release of 8.0 since its announcement last december. While I'm still a Firefox user from the very beginning I also like Opera very much and always consider it as my person #2 :-)
