<a href="http://o2.openphoto.net/">Open Photo Project | Version v2.01_ALPHA</a>

-------------------------------



The Open Photo Project is, as far as I can tell, somehow similiar to services like <a href="http://www.sxc.hu">sxc.hu</a> where people share photos that can be used by other people for their works under specific licenses. This project uses the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">creative commons licenses</a> for the photos hosted there.
