title: w00t Charmed DVDs
---


Today I finally got my copy of the first season box of Charmed. Since the package is not yet available in Europe and there isn't even a release date for the german edition yet I ordered the the DVDs on <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a>. I also had to pay additional 15EUR for toll... this definitely sucks but it's probably still much cheaper than getting the DVDs from the UK in April or waiting for Paramount to make a german package :-?

Anyway, here are some package shots ;-)
