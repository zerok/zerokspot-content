title: Flickr Pro et al. ;-)
---


After coming back from a little trip with my new bike I finally got a Flickr Pro account :D Why? I needed more photo sets ;-) I plan to make of everything a set that belongs together, like photos about a trip, a party etc. ... not that I'm on oh so many parties, but I think you got the point ;-) I also changed my uploads habits now that I have a pro account: Gone are the days of 1024x768 photos *g* Say hello to 1280x1024 photos ;-) I could upload the original photos but I see only very little point in (1) stessing the flickr servers more than necessary and (2) they don't really look all that great in 2048x1536.

About the party thing: Not really a party but a festival: This May there will be a big music festival in Wiener Neustadt with bands like Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Incubus, The Prodigy, The Hives, Asian Dub Foundation, Naked Lunch and many many more. The <a href="http://www.aerodrome.at">Aero_05</a> will be on the 25th, 26th and 27th May and a ticket for all 3 days costs 75EUR (camping fee included). Sounds quite interesting for me (since being a Limp Bizkit fan) so I will probably start talking with some people ;-)



Another thing: I somehow can't get feedburner.com to recognize my RSS2 feed. When I point it to the URL it seems to get a 404 error message which I can't really reproduce :S So no feedburner for now.
