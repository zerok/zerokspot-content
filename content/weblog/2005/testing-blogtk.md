title: Testing BloGTK
---


<p>After some time I now want to give BloGTK another try. This is a program for publishing weblog posts through a "offline" Python/GTK2 application. I see this also as some kind of test if I've fixed a small problem in the xmlrpc.php of WordPress 1.5 or not :-)</p>

-------------------------------

<p>If you also want to give BloGTK a try, you can get it on <a href="http://blogtk.sf.net">BloGTK.sf.net</a>. </p>

<p>Let's see ;-)</p>
