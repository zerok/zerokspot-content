title: 'KPDF: My new favorite PDF viewer'
---


<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/kpdf-about.jpg" alt="" class="left"/> During the last couple of yours using Linux I've basically used every available PDF viewer that is available. Firstr (thanks to being bundled with KDE) KGhostview, then I went to Adobe Acrobat Reader for Linux because of the better compatibility (to be honest I'm not sure anymore why I switched but this is a good guess ;-) ), then to XPDF because of its simplicity and speed. Since last winter I'm also often using GGV and previously GPDF because of me being a Gnome user. In the last couple of month I'm more or less using all of them depending on my motivation and the weather.

-------------------------------



Yesterday I've tried the new KPDF that is bundled with KDE 3.4 ... and I really love it. It is fast, simple and offers everything I want:

* A "table of contents" sidebar (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>)
* A page-preview sidebar
* Speed
* A really powerful selection tool (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>)
* KPDF also remembers the last position in a document so that you start on the same page when reopening the document later.
* Fast mouse scrolling: Ok, this may sound trivial, but I really like navigating through my docs with my mouse wheel and KPDF simply has the right speed for me ;-)
