title: Preparing plugins for WP2.0
---


With the release of WordPress 2.0 being imminent (at least that's how it looks like to me ;) ) I started to check all the plugins I'm using here a few days ago to make sure, that they all work with the new major release. After 2 days now I have only one plugin left: Eric Meyer's wp-gatekeeper, which I should have finished soon. So far only Jerome's keywords plugin required some debugging and updating (which took me quite some time though). Now I just hope, that WordPress 2.0 will be released soon :D Just too bad, that the RTE doesn't work with Safari :(

For some details on what things might be a problem with using a 1.5 plugin with WP2.0, there's a nice article on <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/archives/2005/12/05/wordpress-20-rc1-plugins-and-url-rewriting/">neato.co.nz</a>  :)
