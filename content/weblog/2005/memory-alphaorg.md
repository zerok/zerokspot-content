If you're looking for a StarTrek encyclopedia written in Wiki-style, then memory-alpha.org is perhaps something for you. The site seems to be online since November 2003 and uses MediaWiki as engine. The main language seems to be English but there is also a German section since May 2004 and a Dutch section.
