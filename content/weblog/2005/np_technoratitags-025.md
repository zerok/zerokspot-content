[Think about the rest of the sections of the previous announcement here]

-------------------------------



<h4>New in this release</h4>

<ul>

<li>The tags table now gets queried only once per page and not once per item anymore. I have currently no real motivation to integrate the tags into the items table because it would (at best) only improve the whole thing with one query less to do.</li>

</ul>
