title: SVN as a lifesaver
---


Since about 3 months I'm using subversion to manage all my source code files of all my tiny personal projects as well as for these homeworks that have anything to do with programming. Until today I used it more or less only to be able to undo whatever sh*t leaves my fingers too fast. But today it got its first appearance in the role of a lifesaver and backup system. During some testing I accidentally deleted my whole work folder which held the work of about 3 weeks. Thanks to subversion I only lost one file which I've somehow forgotten to add to repository :-?

-------------------------------



Sure, any versioning and backup system can do this, but I'm using Subversion so I want to once again thank the developers of this great system for their hard work :-)
