title: 'EuroOSCON: The last day ;)'
---


Late again. Sorry for that but I had quite a lot to do. Anyway: The last day was rather unspectacular but nevertheless very interesting:

-------------------------------



<dl>

<dt>Keynotes</dt><dd><p>While all keynotes were good (esp. the one about Ruby on Rails ;)) my personal highlight was definitely and once again the speech of Damian Conway presenting his new business idea ;)</p><dd>

<dt>Developing with Mono : Dumbill</dt><dd><p>Basically a short introduction in Mono by the author of the Developer's Notebook on Mono. Really nice and ...well, I bought his book right after lunch and started messing around with it on the day I got home ;)</p><dd>

<dt>Tastes Like Freedom: GNOME and Ubuntu : Waugh</dt><dd><p>Jeff Waugh introduced a few Gnome and Mono-related projects as well as Ubuntu. As always entertaining ;)</p></dd>

<dt>Learning Haskell : Tang</dt><dd><p>Functional programming is sick... *g* I don't have to say anything else about it ;)</p></dd>

<dt>Europe's Coming Broadcast Flag : Doctorow</dt><dd><p>Great speech with enough emotion to bring everyone onto the barricades.</dt>

</dl>



Well, that's it. Great con with perhaps a little bit to little relation to European projects ... but great muffins ;)
