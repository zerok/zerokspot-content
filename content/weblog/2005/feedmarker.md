<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/uploads/feedmarker.jpg" alt="" class="left"/>Thanks to <a href="http://www.fiftyfoureleven.com/weblog/news-rants-and-ephemera/amidst-all-the-hype-feedmarker">fiftyfoureleven</a> I found yet another RSS/Atom reader for me to try :D  At the first look <a href="http://www.feedmarker.com/">Feedmarker</a> seems to be like a combination of Bloglines and del.icio.us since it (according to the about page) combines RSS feed aggregation with tagging.

I'm not really sure how this will work out but I'm definitely going to give it a try tomorrow ... after at least 9 hours of sleep ;-)
