title: Flickr offline for maintenance
---


In case you haven't noticed it yet: <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr.com</a> is down for maintenance (planned restart is 7pm PST). Quite bad timing since I wanted to show my Mother some nice pics of the Likeside Park opening online, but it's not really a tragedy since I still have the photos somewhere here .... at least I hope so. 

-------------------------------



Seems like dropping the prices motivated too many people to get a flickr account. I can't really blame anyone since I wanted to get a pro account myself tonight. So I'll have to wait a few hours more and can at least get some work done and perhaps finally the damn FeedBurner thing ;-) Wait... 7pm PST. That would be about 10 hours from now, right? Hm.... ok, then I can get some work done and some sleep.
