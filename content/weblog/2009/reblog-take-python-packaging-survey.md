Want to give some feedback about the state of distutils and in general the
available methods for distributing Python packages? Now is your chance:
<http://tinyurl.com/package-survey>.

According to Tarek Ziad√© the survey is for every Python developer that
distributes his code and should help the participants of the [Python Language
Summit](http://us.pycon.org/2009/about/summits/language/).
