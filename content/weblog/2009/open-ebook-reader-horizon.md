title: Open eBook Reader on the Horizon?
---


Just a few days ago I wrote about how much I like Stanza for the iPhone and iPod touch and I still do. It opened up a whole world of eBooks for me I was previously pushing farther back on my to-read list every time I visited Amazon or startrekbooks.com. I actually thought, that I couldn't really find an *open* eBook reader out there. And so far that's still true, but at least now there is something for me on the horizon: [txtr][]. 

The txtr-reader is an eBook reader with built-in WiFi and 3G network support so that you can, as with the Kindle, be online all the time and get new books whenever you want them ... something that I honestly don't really care al that much about. What's getting me quite excited, though, is that you can also simply put content *directly* onto it either via USB or MicroSD-Cards. At least I suppose that you'll be able to do that given that the company behind this according to [Golem][] claims that one of the goals of the txtr according to is to create a developer friendly environment with basically everything about the system being documented. The first logical step there would be to mess up the whole document-storage system ;-) And since you are able to access the storage directly via MicroSD I guess it's kind of likely that the system won't be another iPod database.

Part of the whole eco-system around txtr is also an online community portal where you can buy books, store your documents and let others know about what you like ... I don't really care. As long as I can get eBooks in a simple way (i.e. USB mass-storage) onto the device without any kind of lock-in to yet another proprietary platform, I'm happy. Now all I can do is wait for the 3rd quarter and hope :-)
