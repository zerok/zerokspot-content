title: Finally the right NNW-theme for me
---


<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/snapshots/brockmann-style-20090204-221943.png" class="postthumb left" alt="" />It only took me two years to find the perfect theme for NetNewsWire for me. A couple of days ago [Patrick Mosby](http://friendfeed.com/halbtuerke) posted a link to [LegiStyles](http://www.legistyles.com/) (big thanks), a styles collection by Antonio Carusone, on [delicious](http://delicious.com/url/1378a44951d867472d6555813cbf23e2). So far the author offers three styles: "Serif Black & White", "Haaus" and "Brockmann", all of which offer a great contrast and typography. My favorite of these is by far the "Brockmann"-style simply because it works best in widescreen-mode. Simple and plain black on white with only a glimmer of deco. The only aspect of it that I didn't like was the font-size of the content area. But thankfully NNW has some options to correct that ;-) 

Simply a great style and finally one that makes reading articles within NNW a good experience :-)
