The big news is the exact date: 4-6 May. According to the [official announcement](http://euro.djangocon.org/blog/2009/1/24/eurodjangocon-announcement/) the venue has already been fixated and information about that will be released shortly and registration will start on February 6th.. If you want to give a talk, there is also already a [submission form](http://euro.djangocon.org/conference/talk/) up.

I, for one, can't wait to be there. Tech conferences are just always so much fun :-)
