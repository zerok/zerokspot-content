title: I Love Snow Leopards
---


So yesterday, [Snow Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) got released to the world and right after work I went straight (with a slight detour through IKEA) to my local Apple retailer and got it. Back home, I first thought "Should I make a full backup?". But over the last years I've collected so much garbage on my Macbook, that losing it wouldn't be all that terrible. Besides, I naturally had TimeMachine backing up my documents.

-------------------------------

So I went straight ahead and ran the upgrade, which took for ages ... I managed to get from 90% to 100% in [Shadow Complex](http://www.xbox.com/games/s/shadowcomplexxbla/) by the time it was done ;-) So, now that I have 100% I'm ready to get into Snow Leopard. I won't write about how much I love [Quicktime X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/quicktime.html) (you can record with it ;-) and it now looks like MPlayer :-P), the Stacks improvement and just how great it is to just hold an icon in the Dock and get an Expos√© of every window of that app, no matter on what space it is or whether it is minimized or not ... well, I'm not going to write more than this paragraph ;-)

Regarding update problems: Everything went really well. Naturally some stuff broke, though. Some means more or less all of [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) so I just kept the /opt/locals/var/db folder and wiped everything else from the face of my HDD in the hope of just installing [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) again and having all my databases for local development. Well, not so much. Seems like there is a problem regarding checksums and the 32bit-to-64bit upgrade. I wasn't really all that motivated to get down to the real issue (playing Shadow Complex for the 3rd time was kind of more interesting) so I downloaded Ubuntu 32bit, installed it with PostgreSQL into a VMWare, dumped the whole data folder from my old database installation into it and build an SQL dump which I could then re-import in OSX. Done.

Also: If you're using [LittleSnitch](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/), get the Beta. Otherwise your syslog will get hammered with LS dying all the time. But that's about it, so far. For the last ~20 hours I've been really happy with Snow Leopard. There is nothing revolutionary about it but there are enough little details that make it well worth its price for me.
