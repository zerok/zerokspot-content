Slowly but steadly Github seems to be really becoming a full project-hosting service. Just yesterday they [added a simple upload-area](http://github.com/blog/350-repository-uploads) were project members can for instance upload release-tarballs and things like that. Besides manually uploaded files, the downloads-page of each project also includes the tarballs autogenerated by github (I think one per tag). It's weird, though, that they absolutely require Flash 9.01 and don't offer a simple HTML-only fallback. I can understand the wish to upload directly to S3, but at least a fallback would have been nice. Not that this is a showstopper, though ;-)

Anyway, I guess all that is missing now is a simple issue tracker like the on [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) has.
