title: Release Fail
---


It only took nearly 4 month, but today and according to [Eurogamer.net](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ssf2thdr-for-ps3-tomorrow-finally) we here in Europe are finally going to receive our dosage of [Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix](http://www.giantbomb.com/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-hd-remix/61-20616/) for the PS3. If I remember correctly the Xbox360 version was basically release at the same time in Europe and North America but for some obscure reason the PSN-version never hit the net.

I'm currently at a point where I don't even care anymore who messed that whole affair up: SCEE or Capcom. There is simply no excuse for ignoring *one* region (which was more or less a 2nd home-market for Sony during the last console generation, thank you) when it comes to any title where the localization should be pretty limited not to mention games as anticipated by fans like SSF2THDR. If the game had been available even in December or January I would have got it without thinking for more than a minute. But now with SF4 being available this Friday in local stores I hardly find any motivation to spend those 15 EUR.
