title: Last.fm to charge for streaming
---


Today Last.fm's Richard Jones [announced](http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement) on the company's
blog that the radio stations available on Last.fm are about to go for-money-only
in countries other than the USA, the UK and Germany. This means, that there is
no longer a distinctions between free and for-pay stations for people outside
of these 3 countries anymore. Previously you could for example listen to a
random playlist generated from your recommendations for free, while you had to
pay for a playlist generated from your "loved" songs.

-------------------------------

I, personally, don't really mind this change. For the past years I've found
most of the tracks I eventually bought through Last.fm and 3â‚¬ per month isn't
really that much for such a great service. What annoys me quite a bit, though,
is that *some* customers are not affected. In a [comment](http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement#c007521) [Matthew Ogle][] wrote, that Last.fm wants
to "focus" on these three countries, which is
in my opinion a really weak explanation for an international web services
whose main attraction was and still is its internationality to treat customers
differently based on their geo-location. I guess this could even be a first.
It just smells so much like a typical content-industry move, like the one that
prevents me to get J-Pop (or even some Italian bands) in the Austrian iTunes
Store. 

If Last.fm had moved to a paid-only streaming service for *all* users, the
uproar in the community would probably have happened too, but this way at
least all customers would be treated in the same way. I totally see that such
a service is costly and should actually be worth money to most people, but I
don't really like the way this transition to a paid service (which Last.fm is
now definitely headed to) was handled.

In another comment, [gurdonark][] made a [great suggestion](http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement#c007583) that
Last.fm should perhaps offer a baseline service that includes streaming of
Creative Commons tracks and tracks by netlabels. This way the site could still
be used as a basic advertisement and recommendation platform for these types
of music and show some strong support for independent artists. Not that this
would really help with the bandwidth-costs, though.

On the other hand, many people seem to have misunderstood the announcements.
From what I read there, the basic service (like artist information,
recommendations, free tracks, scrobbling, etc.) will stay free. The only
service affected by this, is the streaming service. And this was repeated by
basically all staff members commenting in this announcement.

It's just sad because I actually wanted to recommend Last.fm to my mom so that
she might find some other artist similar to [Paolo Conte][], but with only 30
free tracks before you have to get a subscription for using the
streaming-service, it will be rather complicated since she doesn't normally
listen to music on her Mac :-/

One a side-note: I'm definitely not running around screaming that everything
should be free (not that I'd mind, though) and I kind of think it's amusing to
see other people act this way. I just bought a 3-month-subscription for
Last.fm since I simply don't want to live without the recommendation service
and like listening to my "loved tracks".
