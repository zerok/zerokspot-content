title: USK game boxes - Lost in Translation
---


After half a year of not playing <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/mirrors-edge/61-21213/">Mirror&#39;s Edge</a> anymore, today I finally bought it. In spring <a href="http://www.semanticmetadata.net/">Mathias</a> let me mess around with it a little bit and I really enjoyed it. But suddenly <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/infamous/61-20599/">other things</a> came up and I never finished it. For a few months now I&#39;ve been thinking again and again about buying the game ... and never actually did it. Why? Because, while I often see the PS3 version in local stores for 20 EUR, all they have is the USK-rated version that says it only offers the German voice tracks.

Let me make a small detour and tell you something about localized games: While often acceptable, it is only very rarely en par with the original voice work. There are some notable exceptions from this rule like <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia/61-20961/"><em>Prince of Persia</em></a> (the &quot;new&quot; one) but in general if you understand the &quot;original&quot; language a game was developed in, play it in that language.

So, back to the main topic: Today I&nbsp;again went into a local electronics store, primarily to get <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-spirit-tracks/61-25657/">Spirit Tracks</a>, but also saw once again a bunch of Mirror&#39;s Edge boxes. Naturally the already mentioned USK-box. So I checked with <a href="http://www.gameware.at">gameware.at</a> and found, that it actually might also contain the English language pack. I guess I was kind of adventurous today so I just bought it and was really delighted when all the voice work was really in English :-)

But why is it so hard to just write that onto the box? The same happened with <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/red-faction-guerrilla/61-21125/">Red Faction</a> and other games and IIRC inFamous even offered the English language pack as a download right after the game&#39;s release. It&#39;s like someone forgot that oftentimes there is more than just a single language pack on the disc. @Sony: Don&#39;t hide, that the English pack is on the disc! Be proud of it and write it on the box :-)
