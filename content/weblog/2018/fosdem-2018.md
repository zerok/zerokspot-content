Well, it's February again and this means that it was once again time for
hopping onto a plane and heading to Brussels for this year's edition of
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018/). Sadly, this time the weather wasn't as
welcoming as last year's. I wanted to do the usual tour visiting the main
square and the Atomium for my girlfriend but we ended up soaked thanks to heavy
rain and then nearly frozen thanks to two hail-storms in quick succession.

Oh, and the panorama sphere of the Atomium was closed for renovation. At least
we got a discount and nice weather afterwards üòÅ

On the way there we also had some delicious hot chocolate at [Frederic
Blondeel](https://foursquare.com/v/frederic-blondeel/4bcb35bbcc8cd13a34dbbecf).
Unfortunately, the chocolate shop wasn't as nice as the products it offered.
Honestly, not even at Grand Central station in New York, which previously held
the price for most f\*cked-up toilet, have I seen a messed up restroom like
this. 

After some warming up (again) and some sleep it was time for the first
"official" FOSDEM event: The Friday Evening Party at [Delirium
Caf√©](http://www.deliriumcafe.be/)! We had already met some friends at the
airport and decided to join forces at the party and later on also grab
something to eat. Simply a great evening with definitely too much alcohol and
too little [wit](http://www.globalbeer.com/beer-style/wit) üò•

And ... probably also too little üò¥ later - *and* skipping the first couple of
talks - we finally made our way down to the [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be/) and
... get our very first waffles üòÅ (No time was wasted on documenting them using
a picture, in case you're wondering.) Before I go on talking about all the beer
and waffles and fries I've had over the weekend, I should probably also write
something about FOSDEM itself, shouldn't I?!

Same as last year on Saturday I tried to get into the Go devroom. After a bit
of waiting I succeeded and managed to attend the following talks:

* [Upspin and a future of the Internet](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/upspin/) by Gildas Chabot
* [Dep deep dive!](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/dep/) by Sam Boyer
* [Networking Swiss Army Knife for Go](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/networking_swiss_knife/) by Roman Mohr
* [The case for interface{}](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/interface/) by Sam Whited
* [Google‚Äôs approach to distributed systems observability for Go](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/observability/) by Jaana Dogan

Out of these I was probably fascinated the most by Upspin. That project had
been on my to-check-out list for quite some time but I never managed to find
the time. This talk gave be a quick summary that completely renewed my
interest. The time-problem remains, though.

A bit more applicable to work is what Google is building with
[OpenCensus](http://opencensus.io/). It pretty much combines something similar
to [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) with a unified interface for metrics,
logging, et al.

Afterwards we tried to get into the security track together, but sadly some
people started pushing their way through and failed. Luckily, we found a nice,
quiet spot in the library with power, WiFi *and* soda. 

Next morning I decided I want to learn more about Rust. While Go is my primary
language for now, situations might arise where I have to extend Python or
JavaScript code with high-performant, multi-threaded logic. Since it seems like
cross-compiling is now easier, I really want to get to know Rust more! To get a
quick-start, I attended the following talks:

* [Why you should take a look at Rust?](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/rust_introduction/) by Antonin Carette
* [Idiomatic Rust](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/rust_idiomatic/) by Matthias Endler
* [Rust memory management](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/rust_memory_management_intro/) by Zeeshan Ali

Later we managed to get into the privacy track and learnt about
[PrivacyScore.org](https://privacyscore.org/), which provides a single score
for how many trackers and other privacy issues a site has. Nice!

Before it was time to go home, it was time for the closing keynotes by Jon
Masters about [Meltdown,
Spectre](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/closing_keynote/), and what the
industry was doing to detect and prevent such issues in the future.

An awesome dinner at [√âmile
Bistro](https://foursquare.com/v/%C3%A9mile-bistro/4fb0f1a5e4b0c546fb51afeb)
and some shopping at the local Uniqlo and chocolate store we were once again on
the trip back home. I'm really looking forward to next year's FOSDEM already!
