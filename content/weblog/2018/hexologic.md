Last weekend I stumbled upon a little number-puzzler called *Hexologic* thanks
to Apple's "new" "Game of the day" section inside the iOS App Store. It's
basically somewhere between a classic Sudoku and something like Picross all
inside a hexagonal game-field. Each of these fields can either be set to 1, 2,
or 3 and summed up in a line they should equal a number printed on a little
flag at the end of most rows.

There are only a bit more than 60 stages (incl. bonus stages) but if you enjoy
either Sudoku or Picross, do yourself a favor and buy it. Hexologic is
available on pretty much every platform. On
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hexologic/id1343246862) it's available
for $0.99 right now ðŸ™‚
