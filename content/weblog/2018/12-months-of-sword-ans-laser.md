This year I tried to read all the book assignments of the [Sword & Laser](http://swordandlaser.com/) book-club in order to dive into worlds that I otherwise never would have discovered. The 12 books of 2019 where the following:

* ["Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus"](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/01/01/frankenstein/) by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
* ["A Wrinkle in Time"](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/02/10/a-wrinkle-in-time/) by Madeleine L'Engle
* ["An Unkindness of Ghosts"](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/03/03/an-unkindness-of-ghosts/) by Rivers Solomon
* ["We are Legion We are Bob"](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/04/22/we-are-legion/) by Dennis E. Taylor
* ["Night's Master"](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2018/06/13/nights-master/) by Tanith Lee
* "Circe" by Madeline Miller
* "Mortal Engines" by Philip Reeve
* "Jade City" by Fonda Lee
* "Slan" by A.E. van Vogt
* "Lovecraft Country" by Matt Ruff
* "Zeroes" by Chuck Wendig
* "Ka: Dar Oakley in the Ruin of Ymr" by John Crowley

While I enjoyed pretty much all of them but "Night's Master", "Circe" was absolutely my favourite. At school I loved everything related to Greek and Roman mythology and this book about the daughter of Helios and Perse revived that love! I totally forgot how intertwined the fates of  Odysseus, Daedalus, the Minotaur, and Circe were!

That list also includes quite a few books that were already on my radar: "Mortal Engines" and "We are Legion, We are Bob" in particular. On the other hand "Lovecraft Country" and "Ka" were so far away from my normal comfort zone that I wouldn't even have heard about them.

At first I also tried to write about each of these books in their own blog posts. Sadly, though, I stopped doing this around the time of moving into our new apartment and never picked it up again. I will try to do better next year, I promise!

This doesn't mean that I will continue reading all Sword & Laser assignments, though. It was very entertaining and I read tons of great books that I otherwise wouldn't have, but my backlog has continuously grown over the last 12 months and I want to do something about this ðŸ˜… That being said, I will still take a look at every new assignment ðŸ™‚
