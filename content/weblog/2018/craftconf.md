In April a couple of friends and I once again met up in Budapest for one of my
personal highlights of every conference season: [Craft
Conf](https://craft-conf.com/). I already wrote about the fabulous venue [last
year](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2017/04/29/craftconf/), so I will just focus
on the organisation and the talks.

But first: the apartment. We once again booked via Airbnb and got a [gorgeous
multi-tenant apartment](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10242386) only about 15
minutes (on foot) away from the Keleti train station, half way to Nyugati train
station. The only thing that didn't work was the light on the toilet, but
that's precisely why I bought an [LC90 by
Anker](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/lc90-flashlight/T1420011) right
before the trip ðŸ˜‚ We got IIRC six bedrooms with most of them having their own
shower and toilet. Just perfect!

OK, back to the conference and the talks:

## Talks

This time around the talks felt a little less technical compared to last year.
Most speakers focused mostly on architectural topics on the technical,
organisational, or social levels. Quite a few companies have now gained
experience with using so-called "cloud native" technologies and are ready to
share what influence those had on how they operate.

Alongside that I kind of expected there to be quite a few sessions about the
GDPR. In the end, though, that topic was nearly completely absent with only a
handful of talks being security related.

So without further ado, these were the talks I attended:

* [The People Patch - Adventures in Social
  Engineering](https://craft-conf.com/speaker/JennyRadcliffe) by Jenny
  Radcliffe gave a great introduction into social engineering. Tons of
  real-life stories presented by someone who seems to absolutely love her job.
  Just great ðŸ˜€
* [Break your event chains! Complex event flows in distributed
  systems](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114862863) by Bernd RÃ¼cker & Martin
  Schimak gave an overview of how you can use workflow engines like Camunda to
  implement large-scale systems. Personally, I don't yet have worked with it by
  some of my coworkers have and it sounds quite promising but obviously not
  perfect.
* [What is this cloud native thing
  anyway?](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114914685) by Sam Newman presented a
  guide to the confusing landscape of definitions for the term "cloud native".
  That and his ranting about people who write the term "microservice" with a
  hyphen ðŸ˜‚ Since I'm now mostly dealing with systems that are supposed to fall
  into what can be considered "cloud native" this talk turned out even more
  informative than I had expected. 
* [Don't reset --hard: Strategies for Tackling Large
  Refactors](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114914777) by Siena Aguayo
* [Temporally Quaquaversal Virtual Nanomachine Programming In Multiple
  Topologically Connected Quantum-Relativistic Parallel Spacetimes...Made
  Easy!](https://craft-conf.com/speaker/DamianConway) by Damian Conway: Damian
  Conway's talks are always a highlight! This time he presented his efforts in
  making Perl 6 solve problems before they even exist using time-travel! I
  think by now his talks are alone worth the travel time to Budapest ðŸ˜„
* [Scaling Your Architecture with Events and
  Services](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114861923) by Randy Shoup showed as
  a collection of patterns and tools around how to deal with large-scale
  architectures.
* [Testing Microservices](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114861966) by
  Anne-Marie Charrett
* [Designing a high-performing team](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/114862103)
  by Alison Coward
* [I Need Directions: Proper Tagging, Naming and
  Errors](https://craft-conf.com/speaker/AshColeman) by Ash Coleman was more
  controversial with my friends than I had expected. In general, Ash presented
  how her company was dealing with huge test suites and how to keep them useful
  by introducing naming patterns. Most of my friends were a bit disappointed as
  they were expecting a more technical talk but for me it was among the best
  talks at Craft Conf this year.
* [How would you test a text
  field?](https://www.slideshare.net/maaretp/craftconf-how-would-you-test-a-test-field)
  by Maaret PyhÃ¤jÃ¤rvi
* [Manage all your tasks with
  TaskWarrior](https://craft-conf.com/speaker/PaulFenwick) by Paul Fenwick:
  Here Paul gave us a quick tour of how he's using TaskWarrior to organise his
  life. He is probably the most enthusiastic speaker I've seen in a long time
  which all by itself probably made a few in the audience look at that tool
  again afterwards ðŸ˜€

All talks were well-scheduled and this time around there was no situation where
headphones had to be handed out because sound from one stage was leaking onto
another. In general, the organisation, despite being nearly perfect last year,
got even better. The lunch queues were better distributed, there were more
dinner options, and we had multiple registration points on the first day.
Perhaps the only aspect that was not was good as last year was the transit to
and from the event.

## Taxi apps in a post-Uber world

Sadly, getting to the event and back home turned out to be a bit more
complicated this year. There was no free train in the morning again and in the
evening everything was handled through either taxis or trains that seemed to
leave just a bit too early. Because of that, I decided to give
[Taxify](https://taxify.eu/) a try. I had seen their logo on some of the cars
driving by the train station, looked them up, and thought it was worth a shot
ðŸ˜‰

Luckily, it worked as well as I had hoped with good updates about a driver's
progress to the pick-up location and acceptable prices. If they don't turn into
another Uber I might use them again the next time I'm in Budapest.

## That's it

After three years in a row at Craft I cannot really write more. Yes, I will
definitely be back. Yes, it is so worth it!
