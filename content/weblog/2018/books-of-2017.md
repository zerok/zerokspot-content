Last year I wrote a [little blog post with some
statistics](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2016/12/29/books-in-2016/) about what
book's I've read of the course of the preceding 12 months. I still like
statistics and so here comes the 2017-edition üòÅ

I‚Äôve read 27 books (including one audio book and one graphical novel) with an
average length of 275.56 pages (I used the page-count of the print edition for
the audio book). Non-fiction still dominates my reading-list (46%) and does
even more so than last year (30.8%). That being said, some of these were even
non-technical books. I was especially pleasantly surprised by [The Checklist
Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) which was
probably my favourite non-fictional book of 2017.

As for fictional literature, 9 books were sci-fi. [The Three-Body
Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem)
was the most interesting followed closely by [The long way to a small, angry
planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet).

Looking at distribution platforms, I got most of 2017's books through Amazon
Kindle (46%) but PDFs coming directly from the publishers or authors still take
up a significant portion (42%). I've also started listening to audio books
through Audible. As I got a gift-subscription for 12 months for Christmas, I'm
pretty sure next year's stats will look quite different in this area.

I might also read more comics or graphical novels in 2018. Quite a few entries
on the [Goodreads choice award
2017](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-graphic-novels-comics-2017)-list
look extremely interesting and I've already added Marissa Meyer's and Douglas
Holgate's [Wires and
Nerves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29772863-wires-and-nerve-volume-1?from_choice=true)
to my to-read list.

In general and to my surprise I got quite a lot of reading done of the course
of the last 12 months. Due to some health issues I would have expected not to
even come close to my reading-goal (20 books) but actually managed to surpass
it with ease (27 books)! Originally, I wanted to raise the challenge to 25
books for 2018 but found a compromise with my girlfriend at 23 üòâ

Well, on to another year full of awesome books and interesting stories! Do you
also have a reading challenge? If so, what's your goal for 2018? Please let me
