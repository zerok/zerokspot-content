While looking through the archive here I noticed that I‚Äôve never really wrote
about my use of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) before. I guess, after a
couple of months on there, it‚Äôs finally time.

With the rise of ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù, Trump, and Twitter‚Äôs handling of both I‚Äôve grown
more and more tired of the network. Add the constant changing of the company‚Äôs
C-level management and lack of visible strategy. It still offers quite a lot
when it comes to news especially for certain communities (the Go community
being one of them) but as with any free but commercial service there is the
trade of your personal data for some benefit. I think I‚Äôm simply no longer
willing to make that trade just for news where the profiteers are companies
that not act even remotely in my interest and that have shown time and again
that they would do pretty much anything but help you if you‚Äôre attacked (which
I haven‚Äôt been yet).

If you look back a couple of years you perhaps remember App.net: Basically a
Twitter clone that promised to stay neutral and just provide the data channel
on which everyone could create whatever apps they liked. Users and their
personal data were not the product but actually had to pay a fee to be on that
network. Sadly, it turned out that people were not yet willing to pay for
something like that so, after stopping development quite some time ago, App.net
closed down last year. Don't visit that domain now as it looks like someone
else already picked it up.

Around the same time Mastodon appeared on the scene. A federated Twitter-like
platform where you were free to create your own server with whatever topic you
like and have it connect with other nodes in the network. What if you‚Äôre not
technical enough to run your own server? There are hundreds of instances
already running where you are free to create an account. Tons of content in the
form of articles and podcasts explaining Mastodon has already hit the web, so I
will just link to a couple of them here:

- An interview with Eugen Rothko on
  [SoftwareEngineeringDaily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/04/12/mastodon-federated-social-network-with-eugen-rochko/)
- An [introduction video](https://youtu.be/IPSbNdBmWKE) available on the
  project‚Äôs YouTube channel.

For me personally, Mastodon feels like a mix of Twitter and App.net. Depending
on what server you‚Äôre on, the community is either small and intim, or huge and
might overwhelm you. Coming from a central network it‚Äôs easy to fall into the
trap of just picking the largest instance and treating it like a Twitter-clone. 

I say ‚Äútrap‚Äù because you‚Äôd probably miss out on a core feature of Mastodon that
makes it special: While most instances talk to each other (so you can follow
someone from instance B while you are on A), every instance has it‚Äôs own ‚Äúlocal
timeline‚Äù where you can follow all the messages written by users of that
specific server right when they happen. This can make every single Mastodon
instance a community of its own. For example, quite a few people from the
German hacker-scene have accounts on
[Chaos.social](https://chaos.social/about). So the local timeline is very
focused around security and DIY topics.

I, personally, have an account on
[Wandering.shop](https://wandering.shop/about) where tons of SciFi fans,
authors, and book lovers are. Hence, whenever I stumble on something that
involves Star Trek or a good book, I will post it there first. I also have an
account on mastodon.social as this has a very broad range of users and
therefore might give me insights into topics I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

Luckily, most client applications support having multiple accounts on various
Mastodon instances, so switching between them is easy. Sure, nothing is perfect
but the community is extremely active and so I‚Äôm pretty confident that there
will eventually be a client that works just the way I like it.

Another core feature of Mastodon is its openness. First, the software used by
pretty much every instance is [open
source](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) and very actively maintained.
Second, it uses open protocols so integrating other similar services with it is
possible and even encouraged. Third, there are features in the works that might
eventually allow you to either export your data completely or migrate your
account from one instance to another (for instance if you are no longer
satisfied with one host, or they decided to shut down).

On the other side of the equation, running a server, while rather cheap
depending on the number of active users, is not free. For this reason lots of
instances including Chaos.social and Mastodon.social have accounts on Patreon
and/or Liberapay where donations are collected to pay for the servers et al.
So, if you want to keep your instance going, donating some money is an option
and (again) encouraged. Giving two Euros per month doesn‚Äôt sound like much but
if enough people do it, it goes a long way when it comes to motivation üòâ

I mentioned in the beginning that Twitter is awesome when it comes to news.
That‚Äôs one area where Mastodon is lacking right now. Perhaps that‚Äôs because
many folks coming here simply grew tired of the whole
news-attention-addiction-fewer that infected the birdsite (aka Twitter) but
it‚Äôs still worth mentioning. If you come to Mastodon expecting Twitter, you
might be disappointed. For me personally, that‚Äôs not really an issue as I
prefer to get my news through news-feeds or newsletters and so combining that
with my various Mastodon accounts is just perfect.

The community around Mastodon is huge, though, so who knows what it will look
like in a year or two. Perhaps there will be server dedicated to regional news,
or we will have threaded discussions like on Google+/Facebook. Who knows?! What
is already here, though, is extremely promising and it might finally convince
me putting my Twitter account to rest.
