I continue on my journey through the literary world of Sword & Laser and by
accident managed to read the April-assignment even before it was picked during
the March-Madness-Contest: [”We Are Legion (We Are
Bob)“](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32109569-we-are-legion-we-are-bob)
by Dennis E. Taylor.

The book tells the story of Robert Johansson, tech millionaire, who decides to
let himself (or actually just his brain) get frozen after dying in order to be
revived in the future. How he was revived, though, wasn't exactly how he had
imagined. Basically, the future turned out different from what he'd expected
and so he woke up in a version of the USA run as a religious society.

All major powers are currently competing at sending out sentient space probs
and claim new planets for their respective empire. For Bob this means that he
is all of a sudden part of a Von Neumann-problem programme with himself being
... the sentient computer. Luckily, after the first shock, he doesn't really
mind 😂

The whole book is filled with pop-culture references and other elements anybody
working in tech will feel right at home. It is a very lighthearted and easy
read; perfect for relaxing after a long day at work. The author still manages
to build a quite interesting universe that doesn't feel empty despite half of
the character being Bob, Bob, and Bob. Thankfully, ”We Are Legion“ is only the
first book in a trilogy, so I have about 700 pages still waiting for me 😃
