March's assignment for the Sword and Laser book club was once again a laser
one: [An Unkindness of
Ghosts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34381254-an-unkindness-of-ghosts)
by Rivers Solomon. The main protagonist is a ~25 year old girl by the name of
Aster who lives on the lower decks of the generation ship Matilda.

The ship has already been on a quest to find a new inhabitable planet for more
than 300 years; long enough for each deck to develop its own culture. Sadly
this has also led to some kind of class-system where the upper decks are
basically clerical aristocrats while the lower decks are treated like scum but
are still expected to provide for all the food and raw material without which
the ship cannot function. The aristocracy is kept in power by a religion in
which the ship's journey is one to a holy, promised land. This also allows
citizens of the upper levels to enforce their will with brutal force.

Right before Aster was born, the ship was struck by unexplained power outages;
just in time for the previous master of the ship to die. Now, 25 years later,
there are once again power outages, the current Sovereign dies and it's upon
Aster, who by now is an assistant to the ship's chief medical officer, to find
out what is going on and how her mother - from which she only has her cryptic
notes - is involved.

At first I was really struggling with this book. While the writing style is
extremely pleasant, I somehow couldn't get a feel for the Matilda. Only in the
later half of the book where Aster discovers some of the hidden areas of the
ship it started to become interesting to me. And all of a sudden I couldn't put
the book down again (except for when I had to) until the very end.
