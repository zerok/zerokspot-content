Last Friday and Saturday I‚Äôve been away on a little trip to Vienna in order to
visit the [PyDays 2018](https://www.pydays.at/) and the [Linuxwochen Wien
2018](https://linuxwochen.at/). Due to suboptimal time management I didn‚Äôt see
many talks but the few I managed to attend I enjoyed quite a lot! The
combo-event (PyDays is actually co-located with the Linuxwochen) was once again
hosted at [FH Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/), in the
North-East of the city, which offers tons of free space during the weekend for
talks and workshops. Spread over 5 rooms and 4 floors there were around 120
talks and workshops in total with the PyDays making up a big chunk.

Attendee-wise I‚Äôm starting to think that PyDays has evolved to the leading
event here. They even managed to get some international speakers like Ana
Balica but also some well-known locals like Armin Ronacher and Florian
Apolloner. I‚Äôm really looking forward to watching some of the talks that I
missed once they become available via YouTube et al.

On Saturday afternoon I also managed to visit the [Maker Faire
Vienna](https://makerfairevienna.com/)‚Ä¶ ok, I just made it to the food trucks,
but those were great üòÅ A late lunch there and a quick visit to the [Green
World Tour
Vienna](https://autarkia.info/green-world-tour-messen-besucher/green-world-tour-wien/)
right next to the Maker Faire concluded my trip to Vienna. We went straight to
the main station and hopped on the next available train back to Graz. 

Before I forget, this was also the first time I stayed at the [Motel
One](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/vienna/hotel-vienna-hauptbahnhof/)
right next to the main station. If you‚Äôre planning to stay in Vienna for a
couple of days and travel via train, this is really a great option. It has 17
floors so there is a good chance you will have a great view over the city!
