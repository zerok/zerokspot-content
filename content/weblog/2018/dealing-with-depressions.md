Hi, my name is Horst and I have depressions and previously also anxiety and
panic attacks. In this post I want to write a little bit about my condition and
how I'm dealing with it in order to perhaps show others having similar problems
that they are not alone.

It all started for me in early 2017 when I met someone, fell in love, and all
of a sudden my whole life was turned upside down with just too many new
experiences to count and my mind and body to handle. Physically, I had been
going through a rather strict diet for a couple of years and I've been getting
less and less sleep due to my "Getting a life"-goal for 2017. That all brought
my body to its limit. Mentally, I had been close to work-related burnout so all
these new triggers and feeling pushed me over the edge. I fell into a deep
depression because I was afraid of losing myself and not being able to handle
it all.

My mind was beginning to find enemies I could blame for my condition and
started to categorise everything and everyone new around me as bad. This went
pretty far and I went down some rather deep rabbit holes. Luckily, though, I
had some help. The hospital in Graz (which is also one of the largest in
Europe) has an ambulatory care centre for psychological emergencies. Five
minutes after arriving there I was already in a room with a doctor and could
openly talk to her for nearly an hour before I was finally done with my story.

This is also the first and probably most important thing I've learnt about my
condition: Talking openly with others and esp. with people not being a directly
affected party (family, friends, loved ones...) helps *a lot*.

Going to the hospital and that first contact with a doctor was extremely
important for allowing myself to finally recognise that something was off about
my thinking. Sadly, though, I overestimated what one visit could achieve here.
Before it eventually got better, I had all of the things below:

* Short-term memory loss esp. emotions I felt at certain times
* Complete paralysis (lasting a couple of hours)
* Something that I can now only describe as "white noise" (complete panic with
  all senses being drowned by something that can probably be best compared to
  an extremely loud and high-pitched sound)
* Barely controllable tremors usually triggered by a bad memory or feeling

Luckily, I still knew that all of that wasn't me and so I made another
important decision: I went to consult a psycho-therapist and a psychiatrist to
learn how to deal with all of that. Slowly but steadily my health improved
(with some relapses but still) and I learnt a couple of tricks along the way:

* I learnt to laugh openly without caring what other people think. Laughing is
  pretty much the arch-enemy of bad thoughts and depressions and I try to use
  it as much and intensely as possible.
* I learnt to recognise the beauty all around me and even the smallest signs of
  joy in my life. One example for this is that I'm automatically happy whenever
  I see a squirrel in the morning. Not much can make such a day bad again.
* Place that had become dark for me (since I had a panic attack there, for
  instance) can be reprogrammed again. I can finally go to our local
  running-sushi restaurant without fear and actually really enjoy it now! In
  case you haven't watched Pixar's Inside Out, this is something that is
  described there in detail.

These have helped me move past my initial panic- and anxiety attacks which
means that I'm now at a point where I only have "depressions" left on my list.
They still visit me nearly every day but at least under control (Nothing a
squirrel can't fix!). My primary goal for this year is getting closer to being
my former self and also ideally be med-free again.

I really want to thank my girlfriend, friends, family, therapists, and doctors
who've helped me so much over the course of the last 11 months. Keeping it
together was and still is never easy, but with their help I have hope and I've
discovered how much joy there already is in my life. Thank you!
