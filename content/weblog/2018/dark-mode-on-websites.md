One of the main motivators for upgrading to macOS 10.14 was the better
integration of a dark theme. Now, if only there were a way to automatically
switch website themes between a light and a dark mode whenever the host
operating system made such a switch. Thanks to [Dries Buytaert's
blog](https://dri.es/adding-support-for-dark-mode-to-web-applications) I learnt
about a new `prefers-color-scheme` media query Apple will release with the next
version of Safari.

Since Sept 25 there is also a [ticket in Mozilla's bugzilla instance for
Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1494034) and a similar
one in [Chromium's issue
tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=889087). I
cannot wait for both of them to land ðŸ˜€
