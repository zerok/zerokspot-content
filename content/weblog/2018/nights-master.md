I totally forgot to write about last month’s Sword & Laser assignment [Night’s
Master][nm] by Tanith Lee. I went into this without any real expectation as I
didn’t know the author nor that series (“Tales from the Flat Earth”) and
fantasy is usually not my thing. That being said, this book surprised me by
being a collection of myths. Not about someone from the Greek or North
mythology but instead everything takes place on a different Earth divided into
three planes (heaven, earth, underworld). This particular book is centered
around the dark prince of the underworld Azhrarn.

I normally enjoy classical myths quite a lot and was impressed by how vivid the
author mentioned to imagine the world around Azhrarn. What stood out to me was
that the prince wasn’t really evil per-se but just extremely self-centered.
Whatever brings him entertainment is good. If it benefits other people that’s
OK. That behavior coming from someone who rules an “underworld” full of daemons
was something new.

What I also really liked was the depiction of the gods as beings that simply
didn’t care about anything. Greek mythology has some hints in that direction
but Tanith Lee pushed that mindset to the maximum with the gods not even caring
what happened around the ruler of the underworld.

To summarize, I quite enjoyed this book but I’m pretty sure I won’t find the
time to read other entries in that series. If you enjoy fantasy, though, and
haven’t read “Night’s Master” yet, give it a try 🙂
