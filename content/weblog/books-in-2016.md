In the last Sword & Laser [episode][] of the year Veronica and Tom mentioned a
nice [post][] by Iain Bertram on Goodreads where he analysed all the books he
read during the last year. While he focused on the authors' and main
protagonists' gender, I wanted to take a look at the reading formats and genres
I had been reading throughout the year. Goodreads itself already has a very
simple [overview page][] but I wanted to also see some other metrics here.

After a bit of spreadsheet magic here's what I've learnt: I've read 20 books,
with about 30% of them being technical and another 30% being
science-fiction. I've even read 2 fantasy books. Most of these books (50%) were
PDFs purchased on platforms like [Inkshares][], [O'Reilly][], or even the
respective author's website. The average book had ~263 pages with the longest one
ending after 720 pages (the usual suspect).

I'm actually pretty happy with the mix of genres and the lead of non-Kindle
books this year. Inkshares, especially, has become an important place when
looking for new things to read. I'm pretty that won't change in 2017.

Sadly, I've also started to amass quite a pile-of-shame
with [Cooking for Geeks][] and [Learning Swift][] having been on my "in-progress
list" since January and June, respectively. I'm still trying to make my way
through them ðŸ˜‰
