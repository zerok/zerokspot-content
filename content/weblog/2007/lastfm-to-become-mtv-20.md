title: Last.fm to become MTV 2.0?
---


Remember the days when MTV was actually good? I mean when they showed music videos? Yeah, it's been a looooong time. Now Last.fm is on the verge of offering all those people who miss these good old days an extension to their current music recommendation service:

<blockquote><p>Last.fm will soon be able to offer its users personalised channels from the largest legal catalogue of music videos on the web. The quality of videos on Last.fm will be significantly higher than that of YouTube, with audio encoded at 128kbps compared to YouTube's 64kbps.</p><p>Last.fm aims eventually to have every music video ever made on the site, from the latest hits to underground obscurities to classics from the past.</p><cite><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/5/prweb525152.htm">Press release</a></cite></blockquote>

Very nice :-) Now I just hope that their service will be a little bit more performant (on the Flash side) than YouTube.
