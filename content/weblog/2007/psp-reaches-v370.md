title: PSP reaches v3.70

Yet another firmware version for the PSP, but this time there is even something useful in there and not just another hit at people who just want to have some additional software on their little black box ;-) [via [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/gaming/arms-race/psp-firmware-370-emerges-from-mother-sony-298454.php)]

-------------------------------

So what's new about them? Well, first of all, you can now finally really skin that damn GUI. Another great feature esp. for people who use the PSP to watch videos is probably that you're now supposed to be able to see an overview of scenes in a video (also during playback).

For more details check out the respective info page in the support section of yourpsp.com.

It's still a real PITA to find the actual download on that Sony page :-(
