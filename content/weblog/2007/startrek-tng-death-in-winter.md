title: 'Star Trek TNG: Death in Winter'
---


Next book in my travel to Star Trek literature and again a TNG book. 
[Death in Winter](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Generation-Death-Winter/dp/0743497228/) is set right after the end of **Nemesis** or even
I guess after *Trust yourself when all men doubt you*, the last story in
the TNG anniversary anthology [The Sky's the Limit](http://www.amazon.com/Skys-Limit-Star-Trek-Generation/dp/0743492552/) with Captain Picard
trying to deal with his close friend and secret love (secret for whom isn't
really the question here, I guess) transferring over to SF Medical.

But right after getting there she accepts a secret mission into Romulan 
territory and goes missing.
So guess who SF asks to go after her \*rolleyes\*. Bingo: Picard and 2 of
former colleagues from the Stargazer, his former head of security [Peter Joseph][] and his former CMO [Carter Greyhorse][] who is the only person 
who might be able to solve a medical problem on that Romulan-occupied world
and is therefor released from prison.

As a side-story you also learn about some fights between the new Praetor 
[Tal'Aura][], Commander [Donatra][] and a Romulan nobleman Eborion_ which is
to some degree relevant for the other story, but I somehow ... well, it for
some reason simply felt wrong. Don't get me wrong, it was interesting to learn
something about the social Top1000 on Romulus, but at least the conflict with
Donatra was simply in no way relevant for the rest of the story (for the 
timeline it definitely was important, but not for this particular book). 

Another bummer for me was the way in which some of the guest appearances were
handled. For example [Janeway][] has a short appearance and also Tomalak joins 
the party, but none of them (and Janeway in particular) seem absolutely
replaceable and at least I got the feeling that they only were used to 
avoid some extra character development. Not even Sela (\*rolleyes\* again) 
felt irreplaceable here. They all get mentioned, do a thing or two, but 
nothing only they could have done in this particular way.
