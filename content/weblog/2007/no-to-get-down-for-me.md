title: No "To Get Down" for me :-/
---


A few days ago when I was watching ["The Italian Job"](http://imdb.com/title/tt0317740/) (the new one with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron etc.) I heard a song that I absolutely wanted to have. After some googling I found name and artist ("To Get Down" by Timo Maas) and started looking for an online store where I could get this song.

-------------------------------

First of all I went to iTunes. Nope, only his newest album is there and this is only available in the classic DRM'd format. No thanks.

Then I asked [Stefan](http://www.leftontheweb.com) and he gave me the URLs of some online stores for DJs. On one of them ([beatport](http://www.beatport.com)) I found the track, entered my CC info and clicked the "Buy" button...

Great. Sometimes I really get the impression, that some people don't even want to sell music. It's just there to mock people like me.
