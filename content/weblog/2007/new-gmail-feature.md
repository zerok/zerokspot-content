Wow, seems like other people wanted this feature in GMail as well. What I'm
talking about? Colored labels :D Last night Google updated its free mail
service to also let its users define the color of labels. Here you can
choose from 12 different color combinations (you can have the color in the 
fore- or background) to make it easier for you to keep an overview
over your inbox. 

The only downside? For now you seem to be stuck with these 12 (or actually
24) colors and 
can't define your own. No idea why they didn't include that in the first
place but perhaps we're lucky and it will be added later on.
