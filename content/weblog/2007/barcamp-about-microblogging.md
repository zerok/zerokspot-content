title: Barcamp about Microblogging
---


<img class="left" alt="" src="/media/2007/twittercamp.png" />A different Barcamp is about to be held in April next year in Venice. The 
focus here seems to be microblogging, hence the title "[Twittercamp](http://barcamp.org/twittercamp)" which
will perhaps give it a totally different flair than all the Barcamps I've
attended so far. And I love the [logo](http://flickr.com/photos/felter/1030688241/) ;-)
