title: First Photowalk in Klagenfurt
---


The first photowalk in Klagenfurt is now history. And if this was the first chapter, the whole book will be great :-)

At 15:00 o'clock last Saturday 14 pseudo-tourists met at the Heuplatz in Klagenfurt to shoot at everything that would make the local tourism agency want to hire at least some of them ... if they'd known ;-)
