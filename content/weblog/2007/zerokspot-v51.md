You might have noticed a small change here. For the last couple of months I've been working a little bit on an updated style for this site, that should somehow look more minimalistic than the previous one and therefor included much much more white ;-)

-------------------------------

I also wanted to use some rounded corners and try some other stuff that wouldn't have fit into the rest of the old design. When it comes to functionality, there is only one change: I've integrated Flickr a little bit more into my site (inspired by what [KWentin](http://www.eloquentin.net/wordpress/) and [Stefan](http://leftontheweb.com/) have on their sites).

Not to mention that white fits more with the season and my new MacBook which should hopefully arrive today...
