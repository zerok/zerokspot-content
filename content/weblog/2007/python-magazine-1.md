For the last two days I wanted to write about it ... but I actually wanted to wait until I had finished reading it. Thanks to quite a lot of other stuff (OK, probably mostly *Halo 3*) it takes longer than I had anticipated, so I will just write about it after being only halfway through.

-------------------------------

What am I talking about?! Well, the new [Python Magazine](http://www.pythonmagazine.com/) (PM) naturally :D Python Magazine is a new source of articles and tutorials about and for the Python programming language published by [MTA](http://www.tabini.ca/), the same folks publishing [php|architect](http://www.phparch.com/). A couple of days ago the [first issue](http://www.pythonmagazine.com/c/issue/2007/10) of it saw the light of the world and thanks to it being free I immediately downloaded it and tortured my parents printer for getting a hardcopy of it. (For those of you who prefer nicely printed stuff, you can also subscribe to a print-edition.)

As I already wrote, I'm only halfway through, but so far the articles were really interesting and the topics were quite diverse: From writing a small form processor on top of WSGI to a basic tutorial on how to write C extensions for Python and not to mention a great overview of multi-process libraries. For future issues I'm not yet sure about the price, though. While the quality is definitely there in my opinion, 7USD for about 45 pages is a little bit high for the PDF version. 

But again: If the quality is there and there are enough articles that I'm interested in, I think the price won't hold me back from getting it in the future :-) 

Now I just hope that this project will end up as long running is php|arch :D
