<img class="left" src="/media/2007/screwattack.jpg" alt=""/>Sorry, another post about games. If you're looking for yet another video
games show and don't know [Screw Attack](http://www.gametrailers.com/screwattack.php)
yet ... well, now you know it. Have fun :-)

The folks over there have been really busy <s>since their February 2007-launch</s>. 
I didn't really care to count, but if you head over to their site, you will
get tons of content. Sweet! Not to mention one of the must hilarious 
Top10-shows out there and also with the "Video Game Vault" a great retro
show :-)

OK, forgot what I wrote about Feb2007. I just took a look at [ScrewAttack.com](http://screwattack.com/) and the content there seems to go back way further. Feb2007 looks just like the starting month of some kind of cooperation with GameTrailers for 3 of their shows. Sweet. More content ;-)

Thanks, guys :D
