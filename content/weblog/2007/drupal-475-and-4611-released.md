title: Drupal 4.7.5 and 4.6.11 released
---


<img class="left" alt="" src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/druplicon.gif"/>Update time again :-) The Drupal team released version 4.7.5 and 4.6.11 of their CMS while I was asleep. Both are security fixes, so it's highly recommended to update ASAP.

-------------------------------



I only use 4.7.x so all I can write about is this branch, but there has also been some updates to the database scheme so don't forget to run the update.php in the process ;-)
