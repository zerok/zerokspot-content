title: Drupal 5.0 released
---


[w00t!](http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0) And now to the bad part of the whole matter: Bad timing ;-) I would love to update zerokspot.com ASAP but thanks to a quite tight schedule for the rest of January, it might take a little bit longer than I'd like it to. 

-------------------------------

 There are still some things I will try to get done on a local installation for now:

* Moving most of my custom modules (for book reviews etc.) over to [CCK](http://drupal.org/project/cck) to make adding new content types easier.
* Checking if the [Akismet](http://drupal.org/project/akismet) module for Drupal 5 also supports Trackback. If so, I will probably activate the Trackback module again.
* Since there is no [Captcha](http://drupal.org/project/captcha) module yet for Drupal 5, I will probably get rid of it altogether.
* So far there is also no port of the [Comment Mail](http://drupal.org/project/commentmail) module, so I will have to live without it for now.

There is currently no timetable to get this all working on zerokspot.com, but I hope to have it all done within the next 3-4 days.

Btw.: [gamerslog.com](http://gamerslog.com) is already using the final release :D
