title: Pagination in Articles is Evil
---


Mike Davidson has a nice [article](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/04/pagination-is-evil) on his blog about the evil of pagination for articles. As he said, it's a cheap way of getting more ad-clicks per article that doesn't really benefit the actual user, although quite a few content providers will probably state, that they only did it to make reading easier for the user.


-------------------------------


For me personally, pagination in articles is one of the most annoying things I can think of.  First of all, it makes printing nearly impossible if the content provider doesn't also provide some special printing functionality (which could be done by simply adding a print stylesheet without the pagination). IGN comes to mind here, were they have pagination and _no_ printing system.

Besides IGN another example for ugly pagination is [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com). Every single page in their paginations has only a quite limited amount of content and the navigation buttons nearly disappear in the amount of not clearly distinguishable advertising...

At least there are some site-specific solutions for people who hate paginations as much as I do, such as a Greasemonkey script for IGN which is  available on [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1377).

So to all webdevs: Could you please stop paginating articles? Thanks.
