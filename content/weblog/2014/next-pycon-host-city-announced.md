title: PyCon 2015/16 host city announced
---


On Wednesday the [PSF announced the host city for PyCons 2015 and 2016][1]
following Montr√©al: [Portland, Oregon][2]. I've never been there and that is the
great thing about it :-) I usually try to combine my conference with visiting
larger cities I've never been to. So far I've only seen San Francisco of the
west coast of North America so any chance to get there again to see more is
a welcome one!

Given the relative small distance and my new-found love for high-altitude
observation platforms I'll probably also try to visit Seattle and the Space
Needle but I'm pretty sure there are also enough great things to see in
Portland. I can't wait to plan my trip there!
