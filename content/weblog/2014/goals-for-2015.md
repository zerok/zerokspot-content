title: Goals for 2015
---


Before going into what I want to get done next year, let's do a short recap of
what happened in 2014 regarding my [Goals for 2014][1]:

1. Doing more in Go: Definitly achieved this one. In fact, Go has become my
   second most used language after JavaScript.

2. More weekend-trips: To some degree, I managed to do that but not as often as
   I'd have preferred. There were some weekend-conference-trips in February,
   March, and November but nothing outside of that.
   
3. More diverse conferences: Absolutely! dotGo, dotJS, FluentConf, Kod.io were
   my non-Python conferences this year. Sure, everything is still very
   web-focused but perhaps I can improve on that next year.
   
4. Even more reading: I managed to [reach my goal][2] of 25 books just before
   Christmas and even got another book done before the end of the year. Next
   year I will tone that down a bit, though, to once again focus on more
   technical literature.

So, everything considered, I can be quite happy with my 2014-list, especially
compared to the success-rate of previous years...

--------------------

Anyway! On to that I want to get done in 2015:

1. **More JavaScript** (server- and client-side): Whenever I code something in
   my free-time, I usually do that in Go or Python (or don't code at
   all). JavaScript is what I do nearly all coding in at work, though, and I
   kind of want to get rid of that divide between work- and hobby-technologies
   again. So: Probably more Node and React in the future ;-)
  
2. Doing something with **Django** again: This is perhaps a little contrary to
   the previous point, but bear with me. Django is still one of the most
   pleasant to use web frameworks out there. But it's not just the work with
   Django itself that I miss but also the people. This year was the first time
   that I missed [DjangoCon Europe][3] and this year I won't miss it again. And
   perhaps I can find a project again where I can work with it that isn't about
   the framework itself.
  
3. **Weekend-trips** (again): I'm not sure how but I definitly want to do more of
   them again. I also noticed that I haven't visited quiet a few of the EU
   member states, which might be a good start (getting that list down).
  
4. More **blogging**: Over the years I've published less and less content
   here. Twitter and Google+ have become perhaps a little bit too important to
   me and I forgot what I had this blog in the first place: To force me to make
   up my mind before I write something on the web ;-) I want to change that
   again and use this site more again.
   
5. No (or probably just fewer) free time projects that I don't enjoy: I have
   only a very limited amount of time away from work and during that time I
   don't want to work on projects anymore that I don't enjoy. This doesn't mean
   that I won't help anymore if someone asks me, but I will be more restrictive
   regarding the requirements for my help ;-)
