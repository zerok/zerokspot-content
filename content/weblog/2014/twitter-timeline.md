title: Twitter's Timeline
---


One of the main reasons why I enjoy Twitter far more than Google+ or Facebook
is the way the timeline works there. The only one who is responsible for what
gets in there is me by following people who post content I want to have in
there. And the order is only determined by when they make such a post. No
curation, no filtering, no re-ordering based on my previous likes.

Sadly, this hasn't been completely true for a really long time now with the
introduction of ["Promoted tweets"][pt] back in [2010][pti].

In this example I got a post by @teespring in my timeline. I don't have anything
against that company but I don't follow them either, so the only way that tweet
should have made it into my timeline was by someone I follow retweeting that
post. Promoted tweets are nothing more than targeted ads. The good thing about
them is that they are also marked as such by the rather prominent "Promoted"
label.

Also, these ads are not exposed through the API within your actual timeline
there so people using tools like Tweetbot et al. don't get them. This, on the
other hand, also lead Twitter to start controlling their app ecosystem more
tightly.

[Recently][tc] Twitter also started injecting other content into your timeline
that is not explicitly marked as such but deemed "relevant" by the service.
To quote their [help page][tl] on this:

> Additionally, when we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content
> that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline. This means you
> will sometimes see Tweets from accounts you don't follow. We select each Tweet
> using a variety of signals, including how popular it is and how people in your
> network are interacting with it. Our goal is to make your home timeline even
> more relevant and interesting.

Luckily, I haven't experienced that yet probably mostly because I don't use
neither twitter.com nor the official client for Android and iOS. I tried the
Android app again to see how much unwanted content I would get but so far I only
saw one promoted tweet, so perhaps I'm lucky and this change has already been
disabled again or I'm simply not in one of the test-groups here.

While I absolutely get why promoted tweets might be a good thing for Twitter as
a company, I don't yet understand the advantage of these additional so-called
"relevant" tweets. It might be interesting for new users but there Twitter
probably doesn't have a large enough dataset to recommend actual relevant
content. Long-time users, on the other hand, are most likely annoyed by content
they didn't "subscribe to" because they would have otherwise already followed
the respective accounts.

Turning Twitter into a news-service like that would fundamentally change what
that service actually is. Having such features is great for new users, but
without having a way to opt-out of them, Twitter loses what makes it different
from other mainstream services like Facebook. That you have to curate your
stream here by yourself is a good thing. That I'm not spammed with content about
the latest pop-star is *a good thing*.

In the end I hope that this is just another of Twitter's experiments that
doesn't leave that stage. If I wanted something like that, I probably wouldn't
be using Twitter. Please! Let me curate my own timeline and don't [change the
semantics][gu] of existing features! At least add some way to opt-out of
something that is not absolutely essential to your financial survival...
