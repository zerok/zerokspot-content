title: Learning VIM (again) in 2014
---

I've used [VIM][3] for a really long time. I think the first time I used it for
more than just editing a file on some server must have been in the early 2000s
when I was using either Debian, Mandrake or Ubuntu as my primary operating
system. gVIM was my favorite choice back then as Kate et al. didn't really do it
for me. Eventually I learnt the basics and got not completely bad at it. Forsome
reason I never even tried to learn the more complex features, though. You know,
those that make you actually good at VIM.

Two days ago I came across Ben McCormick's post-series about [Learning VIM in
2014][1] and it once again made me consider moving back from SublimeText and
Atom to good old VIM. In this series he describes basically everything that
makes the editor special. From VIM's  operations as a language to the way in
which plugins can basically change *anything*. If you haven't read it, do so :)
I got tons of good tips out of it. Most of them were refreshers but there we
some gems like a nice explanation on why you actually would want to use the
mapleader and keep it at its default setting.

Another thing I never learnt was VIMScript. Back when I used VIM the most over
the last ten years I was always jumping around between enough languages to not
wanting to add yet another to the mix. While that hasn't changed I've grown
tired of not knowing how the plugins I use all day actually work. So I purchased
a copy of Steve Losh's [Learn VIMScript the Hard Way][2] and plan to work my way
through it over the next weeks.
