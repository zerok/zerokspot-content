title: Sleeping at Vienna Airport

So I opted to first go to Vienna by train and then from there take a plane to London with a Bus ride being the last leg of the journey. This way I could leave the office at around 17:30 on Thursday and be in Cardiff the next day at noon. Sadly, the first flight out from Vienna to London is really early (06:40am) and having to be at the airport at around 05:30 to make it through all the post-9/11 security kind of destroys any hope on getting a cheap *and* good hotel for the night while using public transport ;-)

If you are in the same situation, [Vienna Airport][2] is actually a good place for you, esp. if you're leaving from one of the G gates. Besides the new nice cots at every second third gate or so there is also [a room at the very end of terminal][1] that is designated as a relaxation room so you're supposed to be able to sleep in there.

While the facilities were all in place, sadly, I had some bad luck. While the whole terminal was mostly empty at 11pm, first, when I came into the room someone was on the phone and stayed on it for nearly an hour eventhough this was supposed to be a relaxation room. Then someone else came in who had a bit of a breathing issue, colloqually called "snoring", so there went the rest of the night. At 3am I simply gave up also because for other reasons: (1) I'm absolutely paranoid when it comes to my backpack so I ended up clutching it althe cots are designed for people slightly smaller than me, so I ended up with cramps throughout my lower body :-/

If, on the other hand, you want to work through the night, VIE has you covered here as well with tons of work-places with power sockets! But as I said: The hardware is there, you just shouldn't be me ;-)

Btw.: big thanks to the nice person at the Austrian baggage-drop point for giving me the tip with the relaxation room!
