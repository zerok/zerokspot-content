title: PyCon 2014
---


I've been to quiet a lot of Python-related conferences over the years; from
EuroPythons, to one PyCon UK, to two PyConDEs and most of the major Django-
specific events taking place in Europe. But for some reason I never made it
to the original [PyCon][11]. This changed this year.


--------------

## The venue

This year's PyCon took place in Montreal, Canada, in the local [convention
center][1] and spanned a week full of talks and sprints. The whole event was
enormous with more than 2000 attendees from all over the world. I normally don't
enjoy huge events at convention centers all that much mostly because all the
convention centers I've been to so far were rather dark and unfriendly.

Not so the one in Montreal with natural sunlight everywhere between the
rooms and lots of space between the rooms to talk or just sit down and relax for
a bit. For one reason or another I spent quite a lot of time there instead
of in the session rooms compared with some other conferences.

## The talks

This had nothing to do with the [talks][2], though, or rather it had: Whenever
someone showed a cool new tool, I had to give it a try immediately.

That being said, there was only very little talk about specific products.
Previously (at least based on watching some videos and attending EuroPythons),
there had been tons of sessions for instance about Django. This year it seems
like the community finally got away from advocating specific tools and more
going into the techniques and purposes and general problem spaces :)

I was also extremely impressed by the keynotes. Usually, these are the sessions
I skip first mostly because they are usually the first thing in the morning and
have been extremely hit-or-miss at other conferences. Not so here. Especially
the talks by [John Perry Barlow][12] and [Jessica McKellar][13] were very
inspiring to me, personally, and I didn't regret getting up (reeeeeally) early
each morning not to miss any of them!

And they were just the start of three days full of stuff to learn and people
to meet again. Just to list some of the other highlights for me:

* [Getting Started with SaltStack][3] by Peter Baumgartner was an excellent
  introduction. Sadly, it is still on my list of things to actually try.
* [Cache me if you can][4] by Guillaume Ardaud took a very detailed look into
  how memcached works internally ... and pretty much confirmed why I usually
  look at Redis first.
* [The State of Crypto in Python][5] was where Jarret Raim and Paul Kehrer
  gave an overview of the crypto libraries that are out there for Python and
  introduced their own [Cryptography][6] library.
* ... which had an unofficial follow-up on the next day with Hynek Schlawack's
  talk about [The Sorry State of SSL][7].

And there are probably many more awesome talks had I been able to attend more
and/or split myself to attend multiple sessions in parallel. But luckily, there
is still [pyvideo][8] :)

## The sprints

Sadly, I can't really say much about what was going on during the sprints. My
laptop had once again it's mainboard replaced (this time in record time by the
fine folks at the [Montreal Apple Store][14]) and the rest of the time I was
playing only around with Python 3 to explore some of the stuff I might get when
switching away from Python 2.

But this was also the time when I got to explore the rest of the convention
center... and nearly getting lost in there despite only exploring 2 out of
like 7 floors. This place was just great :)

## Social events

Last but not least: The social events. Actually, for me it was only one: [The
PyCon Dinner][9] at a [steak house][10] near the old harbor. It took some waiting
to finally be admitted to our special dinner room, but then it was a really
nice evening. It even started with a laugh when the waitress told us that the
room was now ready and she lead us through 2 floors of renovation work. I kind
of thought she might have meant that a bit too literally.

## What else

... nothing except a big "Thank You!" to all the organizers and volunteers who
helped making this event possible. Next year's PyCon will, again, be in
Montreal, and perhaps so will I :)
