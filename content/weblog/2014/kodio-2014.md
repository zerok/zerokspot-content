On my quest to attend more diverse conferences instead of focusing on
Python and Django ones alone I went to Linz a couple of weeks ago for [Kod.io
2014][1]. Compared to other events that aim at a specific segement of the
IT/Software Development industry, Kod.io tries to bring developers from multiple
technologies and backgrounds together to exchange ideas.

The whole conference was held on a single (extremly beautiful) day in the [Ars
Electronica Center][6] at the bank of the Danube with two tracks. The range of
speakers and topics was extreme: [Mike Adolphs][2] from Github, [Mitchell
Hashimoto][3], [Mathias Bynens][4], ... just to name a few, talking about topics
from DevOps, to customer support ethics to frontend design techniques.

------------

While all the talks were great, two sticked with me the most: First, Mike
Adolphs explained how Github does support and why he believes that it would make
you a better developer if you once in a while do some support tasks.
Right after that, Mitchell Hashimotos DevOps talk described Vagrant, Serf,
Packer and other tools that he didn't write and where their place in the DevOps
tool-chain is.

In addition to the talks there was also an exhibition- and recruiting-session
for Austrian startups, which I sadly couldn't attend.

The tracks were split between 2 floors (with 3 in between them) and the stairs
being the shortest way, which made the track-switches quite a healthy
experience! In general the venue was awesome. With the venue being a quite
modern building there is lots of open space and tons of glass which gives it an
extremely friendly atmosphere.

Sadly the available rooms weren't really large enough to hold all the people who
wanted to attend some of the talks but that is basically the only thing I could
complain if I wanted to. But the chairs were just too comfortable ;-)

The day ended with a nice get-together in the Skyloft with a nice view onto
the river and free drinks.

Big thanks to the organizers for finally making me visit Linz with this great
event!
