Last Friday the very first [Go conference on European soil][1] took place in
Paris, France. Organised by the fine folks of [dotConferences][dc] this event
filled the Théâtre des Variétés on the Boulevard Montmartre nearly completely.

It was a really awesome event; and I don't say that just because I finally got
a nice little plushy Gopher :) I wanted to learn and that I certainly did. Every
talk was very informative. The focus of most was on the philosophy behind
certain design decisions of the language (with interfaces being esp. in the
spotlight here), but also quite a few were about general best practices in the
community. For instance, having played around before with Keith Rarick's godep
I really appreaciated his talk on dependency management.

If you want to know more about all the sessions, take a look at the [live
blog][2] SourceGraph did :) I guess, they could use the speaker's Wifi because
there was none for the attendees, which was a shame but understandable given the
rather tight location. And what a stylish location that was. According to
[Wikipedia][wp] opened in 1807 this theatre had a very historical and slightly
posh atmosphere about it, adjectives that you normally don't associated with
a developer conference, but it worked quite well here. Only the break and lunch
location in the 2nd floor was simply too small to hold all the attendees.
I honestly don't know how many people came, but I'd guess something around 400.
An impressive number for the very first conference of any topic in Europe.

The second day (Saturday) offered some workshops for people who still wanted to
use the trip to Paris for some actual coding. I went to the one by [Jeremy
Saenz][js] of Martini and Negroni fame. I had looked at [Negroni][ng] before but
only for like 10 minutes, so I really appreciated the chance to learn more about
it in a controlled environment ;-) And I will definitely use it more in the
future! In a short break there was even a bonus presentation by [Harvey
Kandola][hk], CEO at [Documize][dm] about their product and how they use Negroni
middlewares. Great and practical stuff!

Same goes for the conference as a whole. There are some things I'd prefer to be
handled differenty like still offering Wifi and a different style of
after-party, the overall experience was great :D Now I'm really looking forward
to dotJS by the same organisers in November and also already to the next dotGo
in 2015!
