A year ago [Ulrich][ulope] recommended ["Daemon"][daemon] by [Daniel Suarez][ds]
to me and now I've finally had some time to read it and it's successor
["Freedom"][freedom]. If you haven't read them, do so ... now! Kind of similar
to ["Reamde"][rd] by Neal Stephenson (still my favorite book) the story merges
aspects real and virtual life; there with online gaming while here with that and
augmented reality tech. In Daemon's case it also focuses heavily on how
transparent current western society is and how easy public opinion can be
subverted.

The original premise of the story is about the legacy of the fictional game
designer Matthew Sobol, that is a network of simple computer daemons that get
activated by events in the real world. What happens after each such trigger
changes the world and might either lead to the destructure or profound
renovation of modern society.

Both books are extremely pleasant to read and esp. the second one is
quite action-packed. Corporate espionage, corruption, green-tech, augmented
reality, gamification, private military ... it is all here! But while other
stories end there and move into something like a "survival mode", here the
author provides some nice little hints and ideas how to possibly get out of
this.

While I think it's safe to recommend both books to just about anyone, people
being used to interacting online will most likely feel at home here sooner.
There are absolutely some areas where I'm not sure how scifi/technically-
possible they actually are, but nothing felt so wrong that it hurt the flow of
the story. Simply a great high-tech/SciFi read!
