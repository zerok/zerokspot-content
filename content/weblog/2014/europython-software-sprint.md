title: EuroPython Conference Software Sprint in Berlin
---


The software used for this year's [EuroPython conference][3] website is actually
a continuation of what was original developed by [Markus Zapke-Gründemann][5]
and [Stephan Jäkel][6] for [the very first PyConDE conference in Leipzig
2011][4]. Over the years people joined/moved on but back then just as today the
team has always been extremely small so we are always looking for people to help
out.  If you are in Berlin during the weekend of March 22 - March 23 or simply
want to help with the project, there is a coding sprint for the software taking
place in the offices of [Veit Schiele Communications GmbH][1].

[Markus Holtermann][7] will be there and I will join remotely from Graz
(Austria) to answer all question you might have and or pair. In the next weeks
until the sprint happens I will try to update the project's documentation (which
is mostly still focused on the PyConDE-featureset) so that you will have a
smoother start.

For details please check out the [page at
meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Python-Users-Berlin-PUB/events/168403892/). If
you want to take at the software first, you can find it on [Github][2].
