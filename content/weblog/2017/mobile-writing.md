During [WriteTheDocs](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2017/05/16/writethedocs-na/)
I've started a little experiment: for the duration of my Portland trip I want to
write all of my blog posts primarily on my iPad or iPhone. The reason for this
is simple: I left my 13" MBP at home and instead packed my old 15" which is just
too heavy to carry around with me all the time. My iPad, on the other hand, is
always with me as i have all the books I'm reading currently on it. In addition
to that this allows me to start writing whenever I feel like it as at least my
phone is only one grab-into-the-pocket away. No preparation required üôÇ

For this little experiment I'm using [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) in
combination with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) mostly because I really
like the integration between these two. The final editing still happens on my
Mac but this usually only involves adding a nice picture or two üòâ Let's see how
many posts will come out of this workflow but it looks rather promising to me
right now üëç

Of course, this won't work for highly technical posts with lots of code
snippets. For everything else, though, working on an iPad and iPhone shouldn't
be an issue and might even allow me to focus more easily.
