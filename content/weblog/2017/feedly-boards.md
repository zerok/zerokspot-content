title: Feedly now with Boards

Last week, [Feedly][] launched a new feature called [boards][]. The idea here is
that you can collect stories onto one or multiple topic-related boards for later
reference. The posts combined with your highlights and notes will not expire so
you can always come back to them later. Personally, I'm planning to use this to
collect stories I want to write about here, or tweet about, or simply want to
keep an overview over. For instance, I have a board called "Decentralized" to
which I save pages about decentralized services like [Mastodon][]
or [Scuttlebutt][].

Historically, I've been using services like [pinboard][] or [Evernote][] for
collecting stories. That's because they allow you to simply add content no
matter where I am on the web; be it Twitter, your feedreader, or any other
website. Good thing that Feedly seems to have thought about that and allows to
add content directly to a board by pasting an URL ðŸ˜Š

At this point, the feature, sadly, doesn't have any keyboard shortcuts
associated with it. That's about to change,
though, [in the near future][shortcuts]. Something else that would be great and
that has been discussed in the comments section of the announcement is a way
to [share boards][]. Right now, sharing is only possible with collections. With
boards, on the other hand, it would make this feature immensely more useful but
would definitely also require an extended management interface.

So far, I'm quite happy with the new boards. There are still tons of things I'd
like to see being added there and I'm not sure how useful they will be in the
long run, but it's a good start to generalize the "Read Later" feature ðŸ˜Š
