Recently, I stumbled upon a nice little app
called [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com) which specialised in note-taking for
iOS and macOS. About a year ago, when Evernote announced their pricing change, I
thought long and hard what would replace it in my tool box. At first, I used
OrgMode in combination with Dropbox which prevented me from working on my notes
on the go, though. This is exactly where Bear comes in.

Bear is quite simple: you write notes in a Markdown-like syntax with nice
highlighting and organise the content using tags. Unlike Evernote, these tags
can be place everywhere inside the note. There is also some basic support for
creating todo-lists with notes receiving a progress indicator if there are
todo-items in them. That's pretty much it. What Bear doesn't offer is some kind
of collaboration feature. Since I've used that only on very rare occasions, I
can live with not having that especially since the note-taking experience itself
is just so much more pleasant than with Evernote.

Regarding pricing, the app by itself is free but you pay a subscription for
features such as additional themes, additional export formats, and
synchronisation through Apple's iCloud. This is what you get for around $15 per
year. IMHO a fair price for keeping the app maintained.

For about a month now I've been using Bear more or less exclusively to take all
my notes at the various user groups I attend or whenever I need to collect my
thoughts about a certain topic.

The only problem I've faced during that time is with importing my huge Evernote
notes-collection. At this point it feels like Bear is not yet dealing all that
well with thousands of notes, especially when synchronising them for the first
time across multiple devices. I have a feeling, thought, that it's just a matter
of time until this will be fixed. Oh, and you can also use a simple drawing tool
inside your notes, which just recently was quite handy while solving a couple of
dungeons in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild üòÅ

I even thought about integrating it directly into my blogging workflow but for
now I'm more than happy with using iA Writer for that. Note-taking, on the other
hand, is just so more comfortable with Bear!
