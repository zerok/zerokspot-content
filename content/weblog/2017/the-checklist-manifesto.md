Recently, one of the hosts of a podcast I was listing to (sorry but I cannot
remember what show let alone what episode)
mentioned [The Checklist Manifesto: How to get things right][book]
by [Atul Gawande][ag]. Intrigued by the topic, I purchased and literally
couldn't stop reading it until I fell asleep at night. As the title already
indicates, this book is about checklists. But if you're expecting some dry,
theoretical work about how you should structure checklists, what color of paper
they should be on, and so on, then you will be surprised.

Instead, the author, a surgeon in Boston, tells a very personal story about how
he tries to improve safety during operations and how he discovers checklists and
their usefulness in other disciplines like aviation and construction.

This is by far the most inspirational book I've read in years and I cannot wait
to apply some of the findings in there to some of my own personal
construction-sites that could benefit from some checklists ðŸ˜Š As such, I don't
really have to say that I recommend this book, do I?! Not a single page was
boring and I can only describe the way in which the stories are told as
"exciting". I immediately felt a kind of excitement about the topic jumping over
from the author to me, the reader!
