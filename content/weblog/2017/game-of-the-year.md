Unlike last year where I bought a new gaming PC and spent probably more time on
gaming than on pretty much any other hobby, 2017 was extremely limited in this
regard. I simply had lots of other things with higher priority than sitting all
day behind a PC or TV and play games.

That being said, before my trip to Portland earlier this year I got myself a
Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart and Zelda. I absolutely fell in love with the
latter but somehow completely forgot about the first. In fact, I didnâ€™t play
all that much in total up until November, when I decided I really wanted to
play the new [Super Mario:
Odyssey](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-odyssey-switch).
Good decision 
ðŸ˜„

After collecting more than 500 moons (similar to stars in other Mario games) I
have to say, this might be the best game Iâ€™ve ever played. Not only does it
come with the usual Mario-happy-faces-everywhere flair, but it makes it easy to
just jump in for 5 minutes and make meaningful progress. Unlike most other
games of the genre and also some of Marioâ€™s more recent adventures, Odyssey
also offers tons of variety. 

Whenever you see a new enemy type (or some of your old favourites) you try to
throw your hat onto them. This allows you to jump into the body of that enemy,
put your moustache on them and run around solving puzzles from a completely new
perspective. In Bowserâ€™s castle, for instance, you meet a slightly too fat
woodpecker. Hitting the action-button makes its beak stretch out and you can
use it somehow like a catapult and work yourself up steep walls. 

Every world also has some hidden gems like a sleeping dinosaur you can ride to
break through indestructible walls or fighting a huge dragon in a
cloud-kingdom.

But Odyssey isnâ€™t only a successor to games like Galaxy or 64, but also offers
levels in the style of the original Mario Bros. You transfer through a pipe
into a 2D-world where you complete usually a handful of rooms like you'd have
done in one of the classic games. At the same time this allows you to reach
regions you couldnâ€™t normally get to if you had your third dimension. 

Long story short: I havenâ€™t had so much fun in a very long time! If you have a
Switch, get it. If you donâ€™t have a Switch, get a Switch and this game ðŸ˜‰
