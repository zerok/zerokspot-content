{{<img-left path="2017/33c3.jpg">}} It's really hard to write about an event
like the [Chaos Communication Congress][congress] simply because it has so many
facets. It pretty much boils down to you how awesome an event you make it for
yourself. For me it is simply an amazing event with great people and just the
best way to end a year!

And that despite me not doing all that much there, and perhaps even being
somehow out of place. There's just so much to look at, so many awesome
communities presenting what they're working on over the year, and let's not
forget the great talks and parties ... ok, no parties for me since I'm not
really a party-person, but I've heard they're amazing ðŸ˜Š


## Getting things done

Just like last year I wanted to work on a couple of projects. Originally, I had
planned to do a bit of styling work on the [pyvideo.org][] website and
help [Ulrich][] with moving [pyformat.info][] to [Lektor][]. Instead, I spent
most of the first two days adding a search index to this blog using [bleve][]
and [VueJS][]. Giving these two a try had been on my list for a really long
time, so I don't feel any shame here ðŸ˜‰

Right on the first evening we found a really nice and remarkably quiet table in
the first floor of the CCH which was simply to inviting *not* to get any work
done ðŸ˜‰


## Talks

This was probably also the place were I saw most of the talks during Congress
thanks to a really stable internet connection (compared to other events) and
great work by the [VOC][] (Video Operation Center). That being said, I still haven't
seen that many yet. Something I've started to correct the minute I got home on
Saturday afternoon.

During the event my personal highlight was probably the "space-night" which
consisted of five talks on the [third evening][] in the huge Hall 1. From
learning what [ESA][] was working on to getting a quick tour
on [how large the known universe is][s2], there was something for everyone with
even the slightest interest in space exploration. I really can't wait watching
many of the other talks already available for [streaming and download][].


## Things left undone

Sadly, there were also quite a few things that I wanted to do but simply didn't,
for one reason or another:

* Being an angel: At first it sounded like you'd need a DECT phone in order to
  become an angel. Later, I learnt that wasn't necessarily true but registration
  was already closed ðŸ˜ž
* Visit more assemblies: Well ... probably the only one I visited
  was [Aaaaaaaaaaaa][] by various Austrian (and neighboring) hacker-spaces. The
  model train was simply a great point to meet ðŸ˜‰
* Side events: No parties (for reasons see top), no lockpicking workshop.

Well, hopefully, I can get all that off my list next year.

That being said, we found a [really nice restaurant near Sternschanze][am] with
good beer and I also had [korean food][hanmi] for the first time in my life. And
it was delicious! Oh, and we managed to take a group picture of everyone from
[Netconomy][] attending ðŸ˜‰

All in all it was once again a great event and I'm really looking forward to
whatever the CCC plans for next year. Sadly, Congress won't be in the CCH for
the foreseeable future anymore, as that building is being renovated.
