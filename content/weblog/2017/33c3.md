{{<img-left path="2017/33c3.jpg">}} It's really hard to write about an event
like the [Chaos Communication Congress][congress] simply because it has so many
facets. It pretty much boils down to you how awesome an event you make it for
yourself. For me it is simply an amazing event with great people and just the
best way to end a year!

And that despite me not doing all that much there, and perhaps even being
somehow out of place. There's just so much to look at, so many awesome
communities presenting what they're working on over the year, and let's not
forget the great talks and parties ... ok, no parties for me since I'm not
really a party-person, but I've heard they're amazing ðŸ˜Š

If you want to get a great overview of what 33C3 was in general, please take a
look at [this great post](http://hackaday.com/2016/12/30/33c3-works-for-me/) by
Elliot Williams over on hackaday.com.


## Getting things done

Just like last year I wanted to work on a couple of projects. Originally, I had
planned to do a bit of styling work on the [pyvideo.org][] website and
help [Ulrich][] with moving [pyformat.info][] to [Lektor][]. Instead, I spent
most of the first two days adding a search index to this blog using [bleve][]
and [VueJS][]. Giving these two a try had been on my list for a really long
time, so I don't feel any shame here ðŸ˜‰

Right on the first evening we found a really nice and remarkably quiet table in
the first floor of the CCH which was simply to inviting *not* to get any work
done ðŸ˜‰


## Talks

This was probably also the place were I saw most of the talks during Congress
thanks to a really stable internet connection (compared to other events) and
great work by the [VOC][] (Video Operation Center). That being said, I still haven't
seen that many yet. Something I've started to correct the minute I got home on
Saturday afternoon.

During the event my personal highlight was probably the "space-night" which
consisted of five talks on the [third evening][] in the huge Hall 1. From
learning what [ESA][] was working on to getting a quick tour
on [how large the known universe is][s2], there was something for everyone with
even the slightest interest in space exploration. I really can't wait watching
many of the other talks already available for [streaming and download][].


## Everything else

What makes the Congress every year so special is simply the openess and
welcoming atmosphere. You see something exciting? Just walk over to the person
next to it and they will give you a tour!

Sure, there are some not so pleasant folks (I'm looking at those of you who
critizise people simply because they don't have GNU Linux as their primary OS),
but they are kept in check and balance by the vast, vast, vast, ..., majority of
nice people there.

During day zero (the day before the Congress actually starts) I also stumbled
accidentally through the kids area (which was still under construction) which
basically consisted of a whole floor. But don't get the impression that that's
the only area safe for kids. Except perhaps for some of the party areas I cannot
think of any place were children (young and old ðŸ˜‰) weren't welcome and looked
after. While many other events (e.g. in the Python community) try to make it
possible for parents to bring their children, Congress has IMHO perfected that.


## Things left undone

Sadly, there were also quite a few things that I wanted to do but simply didn't,
for one reason or another:

* Being an angel: Angels are at the heart of what makes Congress
  feasible. Hundreds of volunteers doing small or big jobs (all important) like
  picking up bottles, helping out the bars, doing session-chairing, ... After
  last year I absolutely wanted to contribute more than just a small donation on
  top of the ticket price. But sadly, at first it sounded like you'd need a DECT
  phone in order to become an angel. Later, I learnt that wasn't necessarily
  true but registration was already closed ðŸ˜ž
* Visit more assemblies: These are the areas dedicated to hacker spaces from all
  over the world to exhibit their creations. There are also assemblies focused
  on specific technologies like Python, Ruby, or Rust where you usually find
  folks running local meetup groups. Sadly ... probably the only one I visited
  was [Aaaaaaaaaaaa][] by various Austrian (and neighboring) hacker-spaces. The
  model train was simply a great point to meet ðŸ˜‰
* Side events: No parties (for reasons see top), no lockpicking workshop.

Well, hopefully, I can get all that off my list next year.

That being said, we found a [really nice restaurant near Sternschanze][am] with
good beer and I also had [korean food][hanmi] for the first time in my life. And
it was delicious! Oh, and we managed to take a group picture of everyone from
[Netconomy][] attending ðŸ˜‰

All in all it was once again a great event and I'm really looking forward to
whatever the CCC plans for next year. A big thank you to all the organisers and
angels who helped make this such a great time. Sadly, Congress won't be in the
CCH for the foreseeable future anymore, as that building is being renovated.
