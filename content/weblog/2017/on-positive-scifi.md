While reading the
excellent
[The long way to a small angry planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet?ac=1&from_search=true) by
Becky Chambers I've noticed a trend in my recent reading habit: I prefer sci-fi
literature and universes with a positive outlook over dystopian futures and
post-apocalyptical deserts. This doesn't mean that there cannot be bad things
happening in such a universe. There are tons of atrocities and wars in the *Star
Trek* universe or the *Wayfarer* series, for instance. The moral of the main
characters, though, is one guides by optimism. Optimism that cooperation is the
best way to live together. I also simply live that warm feeling whenever I read
stories where people are cooperating to create a better world.

While I appreciate an exciting space battle as much as anyone, there is just
nothing that compares to this feeling.

Other examples
include
[The Life Engineered](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26494475-the-life-engineered) by
J-F Dubeau or
the
[Department of Temporal Investigations](https://www.goodreads.com/series/61315-star-trek-department-of-temporal-investigations) series
by Christopher L. Bennett. Heck, even
the [Expanse](https://www.goodreads.com/series/56399-the-expanse) universe
thanks to Naomi and James Holden might fall into that category for me, at least
to some degree ðŸ™‚
