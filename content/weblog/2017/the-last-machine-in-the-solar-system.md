While working my way through my podcast backlog I stumbled upon
an
[episode of The Sword & Laser](http://swordandlaser.com/home/2017/4/19/sl-podcast-289-love-letter-to-the-solar-system) with
an interview of [Matthew Isaac Sobin](https://twitter.com/writermattisaac). In
this he talked about his newly published
book
[The Last Machine in the Solar System](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Machine-Solar-System/dp/1942645198/?tag=theswoandlas-20),
a tale told by the android Jonathan about his life in the *solar system*, his
*discoveries* and the end of the inner system due to the sun becoming a *red
giant* and then a *white dwarf*.

It's only 60 pages long, but I really enjoyed the book. You get to know Jonathan
and his creator Nikolai on a very personal level. On a couple of pages there are
also illustrations of the android's journey by Jack Katz. Jonathan's narration
partially feels like an essay you'd have had to write at school, something that
made me like the android even more! You learn some of the wonders of the solar
system through a first-person and to some degree even child-like account, which
feels really special ðŸ˜Š

If you have a couple of hours at your disposal and like SciFi then you might
want to give it a try! Right now it's only $3.99
on
[InkShares.com](https://www.inkshares.com/books/the-last-machine-in-the-solar-system).
