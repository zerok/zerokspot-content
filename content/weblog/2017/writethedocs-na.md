title: WriteTheDocs NA 2017

The long wait is over and I'm finally back in Portland. Similar to last year's
trip I'm in town for two
conferences: [WriteTheDocs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/)
and [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2017/). As this might also be my last trip to
the US for a while I wanted to get the most out of that trip. This means that
Ulrich and I planned our flights to attend *all* of at least WriteTheDocs this
time around. This includes also the hike üòÄ

## The hike

I had heard about an organized hike through the forests around Portland prior to
last year's conference but, sadly, arrived too late to participate. Not so this
time! On Saturday afternoon before the conference we started in the Lower
Macleay Park and made our way to Pittock Mansion without any trouble through
beautiful woods. Then the weather forecast caught up with us and we were greeted
by a thunderstorm with hail right before arriving at the mansion. Perfect timing
for a break and a quick snack üòâ

Once the storm had subsided we continued the hike all the way to the Oregon
Zoo. At one point the sun even came through the clouds and the whole forest
became one giant steam bath. Just amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è

...but also exhausting üòÇ We managed to return home, take a shower and somehow
even grab so food at a Mexican restaurant next to our apartment before falling
asleep in the living room. At least this way we managed to get enough sleep for
next day's "Writing Day" üòâ


## Writing day

Writing day is a one-day sprint on documentation related topics. This year,
groups like MDN, Kubernetes and Wikipedia were looking for people to improve
their respective documentation. There was also a table dedicated to improving
the WriteTheDocs website itself, which was what I decided to work on.

There was a task in the backlog about adding a video archive to the site that
I'd been eyeing for quite a while but had never found the time to actually work
on. While we still don't have a working prototype
yet, [Leonardo Jimenez](https://twitter.com/leonardoajim) created some great
sketches while [Manuel Kaufmann](https://github.com/humitos) and myself improved
the data available about the talks. For instance all speaker data files now hold
a YouTube ID referencing the recording of the respective talk
([NA 2015](https://github.com/writethedocs/www/pull/224)
and [NA 2016](https://github.com/writethedocs/www/pull/225)) and I've converted
all data files
from [JSON to YAML](https://github.com/writethedocs/www/pull/229), which should
make maintaining the talk abstracts much easier.

Before focusing on the actual archive I'm currently working on moving
the [meetup data into YAML files](https://github.com/writethedocs/www/pull/233)
but, in general, I think this was a very productive sprint despite again not
ending with a working prototype for the archive üòÄ


## The conference

As with every WriteTheDocs event over the last couple of years the main event
was a two-day marathon of talks in a single track. Alongside that there was an
unconference with sessions usually related to earlier talks at the conference.

Out of all the wonderful sessions during these two days I probably one
by [Lyzi Diamond](http://lyzidiamond.com/) the most, where she described
how [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) is automatically testing their
documentation using [remark](http://remark.js.org/)
and [retext](https://github.com/wooorm/retext). I just love talks where I get
some new toys to play with üòâ

On the second day [Carl Parker](https://twitter.com/carljparker) talked about
reproducible code samples within the documentation which also included some
tools coming out of the R community I hadn't heard of yet.

There were also quite a few talks about handling feedback, which is a topic I'm
really enjoying right now.

In general, I liked the new talk format that was used this time: 30min time slots with optional conversation starters at the end for the short break between the talks. Only, that break was a bit too long for me, but that's just me being an introvert üòÇ There we're also surprisingly few projector issues and everything just went fantastically smoothly!


## Social events

Beside the hike there were also two social events on the evenings of the first
and second conference day. The one on Monday was again the official party taking
place at [Jackknife](http://www.jackknifepdx.com/) just a few blocks away from
the conference venue. Great food, great cocktails, sadly, too loud for me though
üòî

The second event was sponsored by New Relic and took place at their offices on
Tuesday. The view from their recreational room in the 27th floor was just
amazing. Big thanks for inviting us up there üòç

## Conclusion

As you can imagine from what I've written above, the trip to Portland was once
again well worth it for WriteTheDocs alone üòâ The event simple has an awesome
atmosphere and fosters a level of community that you don't want to miss if you
are doing anything that is even just related to documentation. Huge thanks to
Eric and everyone else involved with the event for simply great four days! And
if you are in Europe or don't mind taking a trip there, there will be a
WriteTheDocs Europe again this fall between Sept 10-12 in Prague üòÄ Hopefully,
I'll get a chance to be there again.
