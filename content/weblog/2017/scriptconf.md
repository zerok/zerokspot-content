Thanks to [Netconomy][], some friends and I had a lovely trip to Linz last
Friday for [ScriptConf][], a one-day JavaScript conference. The event started at
1pm, which was extremely convenient for us as we could use the morning - and the
beautiful weather then - to drive north from Graz, grab a quick lunch and be
there just in time for the talks to begin!  Definitely a nice advantage if
you're living in driving distance! [But never rely on that][fp] as I learnt the
hard way 2 years ago üòâ

{{< img-left path="2017/scriptconf-alpaca.jpg" >}}Anyway, back to ScriptConf!
This was the first conference organized by this crew but you wouldn't have
noticed it. The schedule was near-perfect, the venue excellent, the catering
great; in short: The organization was top-notch!  Perhaps the only aspect I
didn't like (but that's a matter of opinion) was the session length of 40 - 50
minutes. Personally, I prefer 20 - 30 minute-slots but that's just me üòä

[Usersnap][], one of the sponsors, had also a beautiful plush alpaca everyone
made selfies with in order to get a chance to win an iPad ‚Ä¶ or simply because it
was so cute! Sadly, it didn't want to accompany us back to Graz üòû

Now with all the meta out of the way, let's get to the main attraction: The
talks:

* [Christian Heilmann][] presented the opening keynote about the state of the
  JavaScript community using buffets as a metaphor. Criticizing some parts of
  the community he presented a basic etiquette for everyone inspired by how
  everyone should normally behave at a buffet and how to apply that here.
* Next, [Raquel V√©lez][] from NPM gave an overview over how [npmjs.com][]
  evolved over time: Like how they came to pick React and Hapi and the story
  about search on the site üòâ
* After a quick coffee-break, [Nik Graf][] gave an introduction about the
  server-less architecture with a focus on orchestration and how the
  infrastructure around the containers are defined.
* In case you were not up-to-date with [Ghost][]'s road to 1.0, [Hannah Wolfe][]
  definitely changed that. So many great stories about why certain things were
  done in a particular way!
* Before dinner-break, [Felix Reiseberg][] from [Slack][] gave probably the best
  talk about [Electron][] I've seen so far! And all that with live-coding!
* Wanted to know more about how to profile your code on V8 with some additional
  knowledge about internal caches? [Franziska Hinkelmann][] had you covered!
* Last but not least came [Mathieu Henri][] with a live-coded demo-scene'esque
  audio-visual presentation. Party before the party!

The moment the talks make their way online, don't do cherry-picking. Just watch
them all üòâ

This amazing day ended with a nice little party were everyone got one last
chance to relax, talk to some of the speakers and collect stickers (Big thanks
to Raquel for the [custom NPM stickers][] ‚ù§Ô∏è) before heading home. As with
everything else, even this final schedule-entry was perfectly organized.
