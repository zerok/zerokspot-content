Another year, another [FOSDEM][] ðŸ˜‰ It simply never gets boring to take a plane
in early February (or sometimes also in late January) to Brussels and enjoy the
madness of more than 600 talks with more than 8000 attendees! Just like last
year, I expected really nasty weather in the Belgium capital ... but, lo and
behold, at least Friday was full of sunshine, Saturday wasn't that bad either,
and only on Sunday we had the usual rain. Not that it made the queues in front
of the foodtrucks any shorter, though ðŸ™„

Anyway, this year I mostly attended lightning talks with a quick trip to the Go
devroom on Sunday. So many projects to give a try! From [pretty Easy privacy][],
to [passbolt][], to [go-git][], [gobot][], and [go-bpf][]. So little time... I
also attended a couple of talks in the Mozilla devroom but, sadly, completely
missed the "Legal and Policy Issues" track this time around ðŸ˜ž Next year I will
definitely try to get in there again!

I cannot thank the organizers and helpers enough for making this weekend such a
great event! This time I even managed to find a small corner where I could
simply sit alone and think. Luckily, the campus offers enough such niches, but
this time I even found one in a heated hallway ðŸ˜‰ And now that they even have
Flora Power Mate, only the simple unbelievable number of people there or
sickness could keep me away next year ðŸ˜‰
