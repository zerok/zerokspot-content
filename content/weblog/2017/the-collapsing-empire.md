Most people know John Scalzi from his [Old Man's War][]-series, which focuses on
the human race living from war to war in a universe filled with thousands of
other species. In March, the first book of his new series was
released: [The Collapsing Empire][]. I've been really looking forward to this
one and got it right on release-day. Sadly, due to some health issues, I
couldn't finish it until a couple of days ago. So, here's my (rather late)
review with lots of spoilers ðŸ˜‰

A quick, spoiler-free tl;dr first, though: The style is pretty similar to *Old
Man's War*. If you enjoyed these books, you will also like this one. Just be
aware that *The Collapsing Empire* is not as satisfying on its own as Scalzi's
other books were. Rather, you will probably have to read the second book (once
it comes out) for most of the story-threads to be finished.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

OK, let's get started! The story of this new *The Interdependency* series takes
place in a universe where humanity has been using a natural phenomenon called
"Flow" for the last millennium to achieve faster-the-light travel. The flow is
basically a set of space-time tunnels between star systems with each tunnel
being one-directional but, usually, if you have a tunnel between systems A and
B, you also have one between B and A. There is one system, though, where all
human-colonised systems have a connection to: Fittingly called "The Hub".

All of known-humanity is organised in a society called "The Interdependency"
which relies on all systems not being self-supporting and therefore requiring
technology and/or material from all the others. This is enforced by certain
family-clans that have monopolies on things like certain fruits, ship
construction, weapons, and so on. Everything is governed by guilds, a
parliament, and an "emperox" (basically an emperor).

The story in this first book is told focusing on three characters:

- The newly appointed emperox, Cardenia Wu-Patrick
- Riva Lagos, heir of the house of Lagos, which has a monopoly on a certain kind
  of fruit
- Marce Claremont, a flow-physicist

Out of these three, I find Cardenia the most interesting. She never wanted to
become emperox but once her step-brother died, she had no choice. She now has to
find her way in a strict system filled with intrigues, scheming, and ploys where
nothing is as it seems. Supporting her is a "memory room" where the memories of
each emperox before her are stored and become accessible through a holographic
interface. Outside of that she has little help as her long-time friend and
adviser is killed right during her coronation.

On the other end of the spectrum is Marce. He grew up on a backwater-planet
called "End". His father was a friend of the previous emperox and was tasked
with scanning the Flow for signs of instability. Now Marce has to inform the new
ruler of his and his fathers findings that might have dire consequences for all
of humanity. While being technically noble, he is even farther away from the
imperial palace and all its pomp than Cardenia, not to mentioned that he has
never left his home-planet before.

Somewhere in between these two is perhaps the most entertaining but also the
most stereotypical Scalzi-character: Riva Lagos. The heir of the house of Lagos
is someone who tries to break cursing-records with every single sentence. Unlike
Cardenia she also doesn't have any reservations about using whatever means
necessary to get what she wants. That's probably the most apparent in your
sexual activities throughout the book.

All of these main characters are extremely interesting but also pretty much all
side-characters are well-crafted and don't feel out-of-place or act
weirdly. Personally, I'd have loved to see more of Naffa Dolg, Cardenia's
primary adviser and long-time friend, though. Sadly, she was killed quite early
in the book; something that was completely unexpected.

The story in which these characters are embedded focuses on a change of the Flow
that Marce and his father were predicting. Something like that has happened
before (like there is no longer any contact to Earth) but it is not yet
completely clear to what extend those predictions are actually correct. At the
same time there is a revolution going on on End with Riva's arch-nemesis-family,
the Nohamapetan, being involved in and she just coming onto the scene at the
worst possible time. Also this part of the story doesn't come to a completely
satisfactory point with the end of this book. While, at the end, everyone knows
that the revolution is organised by the Nohamapetan, if it will have any
consequences for all the other systems is unclear.

Technology-wise you learn very little about the universe outside of the
existence of the Flow. What kind of weapons are used, how everyone lives,
etc. is all only hinted at. I hope, the next book will offer some more details here.

It kind of feels like that *The Collapsing Empire* might have benefited from
another 50 pages or so to perhaps bring all the story threads a tiny bit
farther but at the same time also start a few new ones at the end. Right now,
there are two:

1. What will happen on End with the revolution and all these Marines?
2. How will the Interdependency deal with the coming Flow-change?

The back-stories of the main characters seem kind of done, so perhaps we will
some new primary ones in the next instalment. This might also be the chance to
open up other plots ðŸ˜Š

In general, though, I really enjoyed this first instalment of the *The
Interdependency* series. The universe is exciting and the characters
interesting. Combined with John Scalzi's rather unique style of story-telling
and character-design I have really high hopes for the series ðŸ˜Š
