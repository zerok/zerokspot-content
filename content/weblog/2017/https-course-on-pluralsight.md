While it might seem like handling HTTPS is easy now thanks to Let's Encrypt,
especially migrating sites to it is far from it. In addition to that, a lot of
web developers still don't even know the basics about HTTPS and cling to some
old myths about performance and the costs involved. Luckily, [Troy Hunt][th] has
published a new course on [PluralSight][] a couple of weeks ago
called [What every developer must know about HTTPS][course], which addresses
these concerns.

I've spent the last week watching all 3.5 hours of this course and cannot
recommend it enough to anyone doing web-development! I'm pretty sure, *everyone*
will learn something new here, even if you've already worked with HTTPS on a
couple of projects. This course won't teach you about all the different
crypto-suits and algorithms and when to enable which to support specific clients
(that's what [Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator][scg] is there for),
though. Instead, it will provide you with the knowledge you will need to get
going and progress from there. It will also introduce a handful of tools so that
you can check yourself that you're doing it the right way ðŸ˜Š For me personally,
the part about CSP was the most interesting as it will teach you how to migrate
a site properly and all the options you have for that.

This was also the first time I attended a PluralSight course and I absolutely
loved it. The segments had just the right length and the presentation as
top-notch. In addition to that, there is a short test for after you've finished
the course to test your knowledge. It's simply a great experience!
