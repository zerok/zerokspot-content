2016 was a bit of a weird year for me. I always had in the back of my head that
I should finally move away from Graz but at the same time I wasn't sure if I
actually wanted to. This is something that will probably keep being an issue for
the next couple of months üòâ

## Conferences and traveling

But in general, I think it was a good year. I, once again, went to tons of great
conferences, albeit not as many as in previous years:

* [FOSDEM][]
* [DjangoCon Europe][]
* [CraftConf][]
* [WriteTheDocs US][]
* [PyCon US][]
* [WriteTheDocs Europe][]
* DotGo
* [33C3][]

No idea, why I didn't write about DotGo esp. since this was probably the most
enjoyable event of that series so far for me!

That being said, the absolute highlight of the year was my trip to Portland for
WriteTheDocs US and PyCon US in May. This city now has a very special place in
my heart and I cannot wait to return in a couple of months.


## PyVideo & contributing to OSS

There I also started contributing to the [PyVideo][] project. Sadly, over the
last months I've done far less than I set out to but I hope I can find some time
during my trip to Brussels for FOSDEM (and ideally in the time before that) to
work on a couple of things that have bother me for some time üòä

In general, I've tried to be more active when it comes to contributing code to
various projects. Whenever I see something that is bothering me, I try to write
a report and ideally even a PR for that. I'm still struggling with keeping a
balance between contributing to OSS and my other hobbies (esp. reading and
listening to podcasts) but I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of
that particular tunnel.


## Learning French on Duolingo

During the year I was working really hard on my [Duolingo][] streak. Except for
one or two accidental interruptions I managed to keep the streak going
throughout the year and finished the French course right before New Year's
Eve. I'm not yet sure what I'll do as a next step, though. I definitely want to
avoid the situation I faced right after my final high-school French exam all
those years ago, when I forgot everything within a month because of neglect.

Perhaps I'll start reading French news or Wikipedia entries alongside German and
English ones. As for Duolingo, I will most likely not continue practicing there
for now, but perhaps I will return for a different language in the future üòä


## Technology

Technology-wise this year has probably been the year of containers
and [Docker][] for me. By now I've moved pretty much every project I'm actively
working on over to Docker (if possible) and am integrating it more and more into
my local development workflow.

I'm not yet completely happy with how configuration is handled in those
projects, though, as having plain-text passwords flying around in environment
files is sub-optimal to say the least. There I'm currently looking
into [Vault][].

With regards to other tools and technologies, not all that much has changed
in 2016. [Emacs][] is still my editor of choice after a quick sight-seeing tour
in [VSCode][]-land. Go, JavaScript, and Python are still my preferred languages
and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Sadly, Django hasn't really
resurfaced for me but React is becoming more and more important as the tool-chain
around it matures.


## Content ownership and privacy

Content ownership and privacy were also becoming even more important for me this
year. With the road both Twitter and Facebook are both on, I've decided to
prioritize my blog. That was also the reason why I spent half of 33C3
re-integrating a search engine and yearly archive into it after moving
to [Hugo][] earlier this year. Everything important to me will be reflected here
(alongside these other channels).

I've started to rely on messengers like [Threema][] and [Signal][] (with
WhatsApp as a last resort) more and more. That being said, I'm really not happy
with the way this whole market is fragmented and how mediocre some of the
provided UIs are. At least I could avoid things like Telegram so far.

My use of GnuPG has also gone up quite significantly. There are still far too
few people I communicate with this way, but that's another issue üòâ

## The world and everything else

* Soldiers on the streets and in the airports of Brussels and Paris while I was
  there üòî
* Trump, Brexit, right-wing populism, terror attacks all around the world‚Ä¶ üòû
* Austria has a (former) green president üíö
* Big thanks to Jonny Cruz for
  the
  [most uplifting tweet of the year](https://twitter.com/JonnyCruzzz/status/796096902794080256) and
  to [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) for at least one smile per day!
  ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Overwatch ‚ù§Ô∏è
* I managed not to play a single minute of Pok√©mon Go üòâ


## How about last year's goals?

Last but not least, I want to review the [goals][] I had set for myself last
January:

* Become an angel: As I already wrote in my post about the [33C3][], I sadly
  didn't angel this year. That being said, I just ordered a DECT phone so not
  having one will definitely no longer be an excuse üòâ ‚ùå
* More blogging: Well, last year I managed to write 60 blog posts! ‚úì
* I didn't move out of Graz last year. In the end, that was a good decision,
  though. Especially during last months of the year I got to know a few really
  nice people üòä ‚ùå
* Re-learning French: Just in time for the new year I've managed to get through
  the core Duolingo course material. ‚úì
* Contributing more: I'm not sure how I should measure this one but to me it
  feels like a success. Quite a few pull-requests were made, I tried to help
  here and there with documentation, and I donated more than during 2015. ‚úì

3.5 out of 5 (as I don't really want to count me not moving as a complete
failure) doesn't sound too bad üòÑ Now I just have to come up with some goals for
2017‚Ä¶
