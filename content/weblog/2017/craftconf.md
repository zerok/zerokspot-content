For the second year now I've went to Budapest in order to
attend [CraftConf](https://craft-conf.com/). Just like last year I wasn't alone,
though: In total we were 8 friends who had worked together on one project or
another, all with different interests and specialities. That's a perfect fit for
the mix of topics Craft provides every year to its nearly 2,000 attendees!

While last year the major topics were Docker and micro-services, this year felt
a bit more focused on social and psychological issues people in the industry are
facing right now. Two keynotes and tons of talks covered things like
psychological safety, intra- and inter-team relations, and how to handle and
give feedback. The latter was discussed in a talk by Erika Carlson and was
probably my favourite talk alongside Damian Conway's keynote about dead languages
and what you can and should learn from them. Here a run-down (in no particular
order) of the talks I enjoyed the most:

* [Damian Conway][] on ["Fun With Dead Languages"](https://craft-conf.com/speaker/DamianConway)
* [Erika Carlson][]
  about
  [fearlessly giving and receiving feedback](https://craft-conf.com/speaker/ErikaCarlson)
* [Diogo Monica][] presented a way how you can manage [secrets][docker secrets]
  within Docker Swarm
* [Jasmine Zahno][] and [Joseph Pelrine][] gave an introduction
  to [psychological safety][] and team intelligence
* [Dan North][] about [decisions and trade-offs][decisions]
* [Woody Zuill][] presented [mob programming][] and how he uses it with his team
  and has seen it being used at other companies
* [Daniel Stenberg][] about [HTTP/2 and QUIC][h2]
* [Anjuan Simmons][] about [lending privileges][]

Luckily, all of them should be available on online within a couple of days
(ideally starting with Monday), so if you haven't been there, I'd highly
recommend watching these talks!

The conference was once again located inside an [old railway museum][museum]
with its own private train in the morning and evening to get there and home
again ðŸ˜Š While last year had seen some acoustical issues due to two tracks being
on two old railway repair-bays close to each other, this year one of them had
been remodelled as a catering area and the sound-issues were gone. Also and once
again, the catering was excellent, but people still are not able to work buffets
efficiently. I will never understand why some people seem to ignore queues.
IMHO PyCon handles that better, but also has lots more space at its
disposal. What PyCon doesn't have, though, is chimney bread ðŸ˜‰ Serving that to
everyone who wanted one must not have been an easy task!

On a more personal note, the event was really loud. From shouting session chairs
to loud music blasting from huge boxes it was not an easy time for me. Luckily,
there is enough green area around the main venue, to relax. Eventually, I might
write about my current health issues but just so much: I will travel to Portland
in a couple of days for WriteTheDocs and PyCon and I will adjust my plans for
both events according to what I've learnt about myself during the last two days
in Budapest: Avoiding loud music, sitting close to the exit to get to a quiet
area ASAP etc. I might even get some ear-plugs or run around with
noise-cancelling earphones during the events. If you see me like that and would
like to talk with me, please don't be offended. I really want to talk with you,
just please give me some minutes to collect some positive energy ðŸ˜Š

That being said, I really enjoyed my time (except for the dark hours, obviously)
in Budapest again! The conference was nearly perfectly organised (once again).
Thanks to [Stefan][] I didn't have to worry about anything travel-related excepted
for getting a train ticket ðŸ˜Š Will I go there again next year? You bet!
