OK, that came as a real surprise to me. Turns out that Delicious was
recently
[acquired by Pinboard](https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/) in
order to keep its vast archive of tagged links available for the foreseeable
future. Personally, I haven't looked back at the former social-bookmarking king
in while but I like the idea of keeping it up and running for archival purposes
only instead of it moving from company to company with everyone trying to revive
it.

Perhaps donating Delicious to something like [archive.org](https://archive.org/)
might be a nice move but it being kept on life-support by its main competitor
(and, honestly, only real successor) isn't bad either.  Let's just hope that it
will stay there for a bit longer than with any other company during the last 7
years ðŸ˜‰ Turns out it wasn't
all
[that expensive](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/06/01/its-the-end-of-an-era-as-pinboard-buys-and-shutters-del-icio-us/#.tnw_imTkKqRL) either
at only $35,000â€¦
