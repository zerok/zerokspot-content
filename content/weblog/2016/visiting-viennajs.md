title: Visiting ViennaJS
---

Last week, a couple of friends and I made a little trip to Vienna to attend the
local JavaScript usergroup meetup. Luckily, Netconomy also has an office there
so working remotely while still being at *an* office wasn't an issue ðŸ˜‰ So after
a couple of hours in a train on Wednesday morning and work we went to [Sektor5][], a
co-working space space with *its own bar* to attend the [ViennaJS][] meetup for
July.

When you enter Sektor5, the first and only thing you see *is* that bar, but
behind a little door is a huge office space which is also where the actual
meetup was hosted. Moving a couple dozen chairs together and a couple tables out
and we had ourselves a nice presentation area. Relaxed, spacious, and
comfortable with a decent projector. What more do you need?!

Talks; there were three of those that evening: One about Dart by
[Sebastian GÃ¶ttschkes][] of Blossom, one about VueJS by [Roman Kuba][] from
Codeship, and one about building chat bots by [Klemens Zleptnig][] from creative
workline. Personally, the latter two were the most interesting to me simply
because I really don't want to get into Dart right now. VueJS, on the other
hand, looks like a nice framework to at least give a try and Klemens mentioned
tons of services and libraries I might eventually use for something. [Wit.ai][]
and especially the new natural language toolkit within the Google Cloud looks
quite interesting for things like bots and ðŸ˜Š

There was also a nice time-limit of 20min on the talks enforced by the
Franz Enzenhofer, the organiser and event host. That limit really kept the pace
high and the event lively despite the late hour.

That's also the main reason I went there: Seeing how other people organise
meetups: What locations do they choose, how is sponsoring handled, what formats
do they use. Sure, organising a meetup in Graz where you can expect up to 20 or
30 people to one in Vienna such as ViennaJS, where you get at least twice that
attendance. Still, some traits I definitely would like to copy in the future. I
really liked the moderation style as well as having an organisational talk at
the very beginning. I might try that one this Tuesday at PyGRAZ if time permits
ðŸ˜‰

A big thank-you to the local team for having us!
