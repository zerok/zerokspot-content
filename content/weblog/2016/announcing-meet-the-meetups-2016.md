[Last summer](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2015/08/24/this-was-meetthemeetups/),
[Netconomy][] organised a BBQ afternoon called "Meet The Meetups" in order to
bring many of the local technical meetups in Graz together to exchange ideas and
get to know each other. Having members of GrazJS, PyGRAZ, GoGraz, the Java User
Group Graz, the Scrum User Group Graz, and many others in one place made for
some awesome discussions and so we wanted to repeat this event.

Due to some internal reorganisation our plans for this year were delayed but on
Sept 30 there will once again be a "Meet-The-Meetups" at the Netconomy offices
in Hilmgasse 4, 8010 Graz ðŸ˜Š

Unlike last year, there will also be OpenSpace rounds taking place either on the
terrace or (if the weather ends up not being all that great) in some of our
meeting-rooms. For more details, please go to
[meet-the-meetups.org](https://meet-the-meetups.org/events/graz-2016/) where you
can also learn how to sign-up!
