Just while watching [The Expanse][] (and thanks to [BoingBoing][]) I stumbled
upon this amazing little website by [Josh Worth][] called
*[If the Moon where only 1 Pixel][]*. Here our known solar system is depicted on
a scale where our moon is represented by just one pixel.

The whole journey from the Sun to the outer edge of the system is filled with
clever comments and observations about our view of the solar system and the
universe in general.

Among other thanks it visualizes extremely well how close Mercury is actually to
the Sun and how much empty space is coming after Saturn‚Ä¶ and pretty much
everywhere else. No wonder it took so longer to discover anything beyond it.

And my personal highlight? The lightspeed-button in the lower right corner üíù
