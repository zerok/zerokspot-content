title: A quick visit at Barcamp Graz 2016
---

Originally, I had planned to come for at least a day but I didn't feel all that
great, so I ended up only being at [Barcamp Graz 2016][bcg] for a couple of
hours on Saturday morning.

Despite that, I quite enjoyed my time there, having learnt a couple of new
things about game development and what goes on at the [metalab][] in Vienna. Big
thanks to the respective presenters. I also got a chance to ask
[Martin Leyrer][] what [bagpack][torrent 40] he has ðŸ˜‰

Something that felt a bit forced, though, was the *introductory session*. I know
it's a tradition, but does it still make sense if the event is supposed to have
more than 150 attendees and the main hall doesn't really allow for a huge circle
to be formed? This way it only helps you with learning more about the 8 people
directly around you. Even in the expedited mode (name + 3 tags) it took nearly
30 minutes to finish and therefore delayed the whole session planning process
quite a bit.

Barcamp Graz is already soft-split into multiple small and topic-specific camps
that are mostly self-organized (think FOSDEM). So perhaps it would make more
sense to move the intro-session into each camp instead and just present each
camp in the big hall?  Just an idea ðŸ˜Š

A really nice touch this time (note that haven't been at the BCG for a couple of
years now due to scheduling conflicts) was that the sponsors tried to keep the
amount of waste down by handing out water bottles made out of glass in
cooperation with [RatioDrink][]. Things like that have become more and more
popular over the last couple of years at community conferences and that's a good
thing ðŸ˜Š

I'm a bit sad that I couldn't stay longer but Sunday was already full of other
things to do, too. Perhaps next year if time permits. That being said, big
thanks to the organizers. These couple of hours I was there were great and
everything felt extremely well organised and the catering was (once again)
top-notch!
