title: CheckIO considering Paid Accounts
---

For many years now my favourite coding challenge site on the web has been
[CheckIO](http://www.checkio.org/). It combines funny challenges with a decent
interface and a great community component. For all these years, the site has
been completely free to use and the forks behind it probably initially financed
the site completely out of their own pockets and later created sections
sponsored by companies like O'Reilly or Dropbox.

Turns out, that may no longer be enough to secure its future and so Alex, the
original author, has
[turned to the community to bounce an idea back and forth][idea] and collect
feedback. That idea is $2.99 per month or $25 per year for leader-boards and
things like that while keeping the challenges and basic functions surrounding
them free.

Personally, I wouldn't mind paying for CheckIO but others have rightfully
pointed out that this might kill the site esp. since the competition here is
quite strong, also in their free segment. Perhaps a model like with
[Marco Arment's Overcast][oc] using something like Patreon might be a better
approach?

Anyway, if you're using CheckIO or have ever used it for more than a couple of
minutes, please chime in here!
