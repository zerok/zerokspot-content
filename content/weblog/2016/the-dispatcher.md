A couple of days ago, John Scalzi's novella ["The Dispatcher"][disp] was
released. Usually, any new book by him instantly makes it onto my to-read list
but this time the release was audiobook-only (at least until some time in
2017)... so what to do?

I've never listend to an audiobook before and was always a bit sceptical about
them. Reading a book puts me into a special mood that I don't really want to
miss and as my free time is limited, I've picked the "classic" experience so
far. That being said, I listen to tons of podcasts so I kind of assumed
audiobooks to be somewhere in between them, books, and movies. Ah... who am I
kidding?! ... it went to the top of my to-read list anyway!

The story teaser sounded interesting enough: A world where murdered people a
revived, a legal killer profession employed e.g. by insurrances, a possible way
around that resurrection...

Two days later: Content-wise, I have to say though, I was a bit
disappointed. Sure, it was free and "only" a novella, but there was just a bit
too little world-building going on. The story itself was fine but too simplistic
for what I'm normally used to from John Scalzi; same goes for the
characters. The book is just too short for the reader to get to know them in any
meaningful way. That being said, the universe still sounds quite promising and
putting it into a more detailed story might turn out to be quite interesting!

As I wrote, this was also the very first audiobook I've listend to, so I cannot
really compare it to anything else. I liked the experience, though, and will
most likely try other audiobooks eventually. [Zachary Quinto][zq] was a good
reader but it was still sometimes hard to tell some of the characters apart,
something that also a friend of mine who mainly listens to audiobooks noticed.

This audiobook is free right now on [Audible][], so, in any case it's definitely
worth listening to if you enjoy urban fantasy or enjoy Scalzi's other
books. It's just not great ðŸ˜ž
