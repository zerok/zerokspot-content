title: '32C3: The 32nd Chaos Congress'
---

It feels kind of weird to leave the Christmas celebrations early to hop onto a
plane to Hamburg. That being said: I can get used to that if what awaits there
is the Congress ðŸ˜‰

As the name implies, this was by now the 32nd installment of this event and I
was completely new here. So find my way around was rather hard at first. I
didn't know that you could pick up your registration-band on the evening before
the event, nor where to find what. Luckily, [Markus](http://www.keimlink.de/)
and [Andreas](http://madflex.de) helped me out here. Thanks!

The [Congress][32c3] is *huge*. More than 13,000 attendees and more than 1,300
helpers ("Angels") who kept everything running smoothly. But not only the
"official" helpers were a big factor for making this a quite pleasant
experience. Everybody there was extremely nice and I felt right at home from
the very first minute. Sure, the large crowds still posed a big problem for me
but when everyone is patient and there is simply no shoving around it's less of
an issue. A big *THANK YOU* to everyone there!


## The "Conference" Part

Part of the whole event is a multi-track conference with usually four parallel
talks starting at 11:30 and going all the way to and beyond midnight. A big
chunks of these sessions had a security focus but there were also talks about
information sharing, politics, hardware, social topics, ... you name it.

As the rooms couldn't accommodate everyone at the event, all talks were also
live-streamed and are by now available as download on
[media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/c/32c3). While many talks weren't all that
interesting to me I'll probably still be downloading multiple GBs during the
next couple of weeks to see some of the talks I've missed.

Perhaps I might even write the comments and recommendations here if time permits
ðŸ˜Š

I didn't see many talks live but there was one right before the end of the
conference that just blew me away:

Here Frank Rieger and Ron give a humorous summary of what happened in 2015, what
might happen in 2016, and (since they've been these talks for quite a while)
also what happened with their predictions from 10 years ago. Simply awesome! The
first thing I did when returning to my appartment in Graz was to look for their
31c3 talk and watch that.


## The Django Assembly

Another big part of the Congress are so-called [Assemblies][as]. Here groups
(like local hacker spaces) can register a table for their members to work and
collaborate during the event. Lucky for me, Markus registered one for
[Django][da] and asked me if I wanted to join in there. Stupid as I sometimes am
I assumed this was some kind of booth were someone would have to be present all
the time and therefore declined as I wanted to not commit myself to anything
during my first congress.

Turns out, I spent basically 90% of my time there and Markus thankfully didn't
object ðŸ˜Š As I was sitting right at the corner to the main walkway I at least
could act as some kind of dispatcher for when people had Django- or
Python-related questions. Some I could answer by myself, some ended up in a huge
discussion with nearly everyone at the table. Great stuff and I hope we could
help some folks with their projects!


## Projects

When nobody was asking questions, we (Andreas, Ulrich, Arne, myself and all the
other folks at the Django assembly and nearby tables) worked on our own
projects. For me this mostly consisted of these two:

* [letsmeet.click][lmc] is Andreas' and Arne's project for managing meetups. In
  the end it's supposed to become an alternative to meetup.com, with which many
  people in the community are not all that happy right now. It's still very
  early but there were enough people working on it during that week that I'm
  quite optimistic that this will go somewhere despite the .click domain ðŸ˜‰

* [carparkbot][] was something I had wanted to write for quite some time. We
  have the weird situation at my company that we have some folks blocking others
  with their cars because of a lack of parking slots. Then the blockees write
  into our primary Slack channel the car's license plate and someone else
  notifies the actual blocker. This small tool looks up the license plate and
  notifies the car owner within the channel and via direct message so that the
  manual look-up phase is now gone.

* I'm currently also reading a [book about Neo4j](http://graphdatabases.com/)
  and wanted to start filling a local instance with some useful (at least to me)
  data. A couple of months ago some folks started drawing graphs about the
  interconnections between various podcasts. Neo4j seems to be ideal for
  actually storing such relations and so I started messing around with that.


## The Venue

To keep everyone from not having to pause every couple of hours to go out and
find something to eat and drink, there were multiple food stand areas and bars
distributed throughout the building. Want to grab a pizza? Go to Hall 2. Want to
have a burger? Next to Hall G.

Having multiple locations for that was absolutely essential as the [CCH][]
(Congress Center Hamburg) is one of if not the largest conference centre in
Europe. While the building itself felt smaller than for instance the
[Palais des congrÃ¨s de MontrÃ©al][pcm] it had one of the largest talk rooms I've
ever been in. Simply amazing.

That being said, I found the building and its floor plan rather confusing. There
were escalators and stairs everywhere and all that being filled up to capacity
didn't really help either. Next time, I will bring my own map. A big one ðŸ˜‰

And yes, I definitely plan to come back. While security and hardware isn't
something that is my primary focus the atmosphere of the Congress is something
that I don't want to miss anymore. So after 2016's "Support-Marathon des Jahres"
I will most likely head to Hamburg again and I already can't wait for it! So
hopefully see you again in less than 12 months!
