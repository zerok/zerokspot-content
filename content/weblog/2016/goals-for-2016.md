title: Goals for 2016
---

So the new year is already more than a week old and so I thought it would be
time to start thinking about what I want to achive in 2016. Last year was one
full of language experiments: Elixir, Clojure, Haskell, ... but I'm mostly happy
with Go, Python, and JavaScript for now (and possibly either Clojure or Elixir
again for dipping a bit into more or less pure functional programming) so my
focus should be elsewhere in 2016.

After brooding over this post for a couple of days (and thinking about goals
since my return from the Congress) I've decided on the following goals. Some of
them are perhaps a bit of wishful-thinking, but I've dediced to aim semi-high
for a change ðŸ˜‰


## Becoming an Angel

... in the sense of becoming a volunteer at the next Congress (33C3). On 32C3 I
was immensely impressed by all these hard working volunteers keeping the whole
event. At other conferences, folks volunteers *before* the event and only minor
things are still open for grabs later one. PyCon is a bit of an exception here
were help is always welcome and some organisational tasks become their own
little community event, like the bag-filling-event on the afternoon before the
main conference starts.

Here, on the other hand, volunteers are organized through the so-called
[Engelsystem][es] through which work-shifts are planned and which also makes it
easier for outsiders to see if there is still help needed. If there is, all you
have to do is sign up, show up, and get the work done (after reading and
following the guidelines available on the event's wiki, obviously).

I guess, for the next congress I have to find a spare GSM handset. Let's see if
that old [Sony CMD Z5][z5] still works ðŸ˜‰


## More blogging

Writing about things in a public (or at least in a semi-public manner when doing
that internally at work) has always helped me with thinking things (more)
through compared to using tools like Twitter which are more spontanous.

Blog posts are also a better way to archive experiences than putting them into a
commercial silo that might be gone from one day to another. That's also why I
opted to start my little [travelogue][] instead of posting reviews for
restaurants, hotels, etc. on platforms like Yelp. Sure, I do that too, but the
version that is important is on a platform that I control and can move around if
things go south.

I've been letting that one sit around for a bit too long unattended, but I will
try to integrate it better into my journey-days from now on ðŸ˜Š

Same goes for my main blog which you're reading right now. 36 posts in 2015
wasn't that bad, but I'd prefer to have at least one post up every
week. In 2013 I had a little series going called "Weekly research" where I
picked a topic I wanted to investigate every single week. To everybody's surpise
that didn't really worked out for more than a couple of weeks, but it turned out
to be a great way to force myself to look at things in depth. I really want to
get back there. Weekly is not really an option, but I'll definitely use blog
posts in such a way again in 2016... hopefully ðŸ˜Š


## Moving

I've been in Graz for about 6.5 years now. I like the city but I think it is
finally time to move on. While the infrastructure is decent, whenever I go to
far larger cities like MontrÃ©al, Munich, Paris, or Amsterdam I'm blown away by
all the things that are available there. Having to have an additional hop for
whatever flight I need doesn't help either. Perhaps I will finally make that big
jump to somewhere else this year.


## Re-learning French

Back at school I quite enjoyed French but due to lack of use I completely forgot
everything I've ever learnt. I've been twice to MontrÃ©al, twice to Paris and
once to Brussels in the last two years and at all these times my old level in
that language would have come in very handy. Enough of that. I've re-started the
French course in [Duolingo][dl] again and this time I'll finish it and
afterwards continue onwards!


## Contributing more

There are so many roads to walk on to help the OpenSource/FreeSoftware
community: Becoming a FSFE Fellow, writing documentation, contributing code,
helping others to contribute... Perhaps I can find a good mix here but I
definitely want to do more on this front than in 2015.

And if I can combine that with doing more with Django, Go, Python, Node then all
the better ðŸ˜ƒ

OK, 5 goals is more than enough ðŸ˜‰ Let's see which of these I'll actually end up
having completed in about 12 months from now ðŸ˜Š
