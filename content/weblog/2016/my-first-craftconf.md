title: My First Craftconf
---

Three weeks ago I attended my very first [Craftconf][] in Budapest. Originally,
I didn't know what to expect. The list of speakers looked awesome and it
appeared more like a community conference than a big corporate event thanks to
its location in an old [railway museum][]. It also mostly ended up being that
although there were some aspects that made it feel more like an industry- than a
community-event. Things like a huge sponsor-hall, dedicate sponsor-talks (which
had some great and some not so great sessions among them).

Topic-wise, there was quite a nice mix: Containers and micro-services are two
huge topics in the community right now. They were also a big here with probably
more than one track throughout the conference days being allocated to
them. Luckily, there were other topics as well, from tool design to XP, from
functional programming to TDD. Also included were talks related to DevOps and
Ops which I enjoyed were much as I'm kind of moving in that direction more and
more over the last months.

Personally, I missed talks about documentation, though. Perhaps that is still
not seen as an important part of the craft but maybe this will change
eventually. I mean, there were lots of sessions about Agile and related topics,
so there is still hope ðŸ˜‰

That being said, I took quite a lot home with me. [Prometheus][], for instance,
had been on my to-do list for a while and after Craftconf its priority got raised
quite a bit. [Kate Heddleston][] gave a talk about internal tooling (which is my
current job) and the importance of usability and accessibility here, something I
had started to think some time ago but now was far more in my focus.

A quick word about the location: I already mentioned that the event took place
at a local railway museum. There was even a train dedicated each morning to
transport a huge number of attendees from the Nyugati station there... slowly
but we eventually arrived ðŸ˜‰ There were three large session rooms with the
biggest even featuring secondary displays for the people in the
back. Additionally, three tents were available for "smaller" sessions. Luckily,
there was water everywhere and on the way between the sessions it was hard to
get around the BBQ stations and the one booth that sold [KÃ¼rtÅ‘skalÃ¡cs][bb].

The acoustics especially in the 2nd and 3rd large hall weren't that great as
the were quite next to each other and so sound spilled over. Eventually, the
organisers provided wireless headphones which solved that situation quite
nicely. It felt weird not being able to listen to the speaker directly
even-though they were standing directly in front of you and I can't imagine how
that looked like for them, but it got the job done.

Will I come back? I'll definitely try. I didn't get to do a lot of networking
simply because the event was just too big for me. Every time I left a talk I
started looking for a quiet place (which there was luckily plenty of) and after
the last talks I hung around friends. Perhaps next year ðŸ˜Š
