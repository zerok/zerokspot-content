The absolute highlight of any conference for me are the sprints either right
before or after the "main event". [WriteTheDocs][] has something similar called
"Writing Day" where participants for instance help improving other projects'
documentation or even do the first iteration on them.

Sadly, Neither last year nor at this year's Portland-based event I managed to
make it there but this time's travel plan made it finally possible to
participate ðŸ˜Š As with other sprint-like events there was a quick introduction
round where some of the projects were presented:

- [WikiData][] (the database-sibling of Wikipedia) should receive a more easy to
  use guide to [SPARQL][] (the query language exposed to the end-user).
- [PyLadies][] wanted to improve their blog.
- The [Mozilla Development Network (MDN)][mdn] was looking for help improving
  their content in general.

While esp. the WikiData project sounded mighty interesting, I remembered that
Eric was looking for some help with the WTD website itself. For instance, some
of the older conferences used a completely different storage structure (plain
HTML tables) for the talks while this year's events had their talk data stored
in JSON files for easier rendering. The perfect task to learn the project and
facilitate further improvements ðŸ˜Š

Right before lunch someone was also looking for help getting started with
Sphinx. I'm not really an expert here but we still managed to get him started!

Our whole table was very productive, actually. Martina cleaned up some of our
internal Confluence spaces and Ulrich began working on v2 of [pyformat.info][]!
Great stuff all around!
