Last week I wanted to finally automate some deployment tasks and therefore
started to dig a bit into [SaltStack][]. I've heard tons of good stuff about it
and so I started making my way through its [tutorial][]. I have to say, this is
one of the best introductory documentations I've read in a while! Big thanks to
anyone who has contributed to it over the years.

Topics as complex as server orchestration and provisioning greatly benefits from
offering some way of having a playground to really learn things while doing
them. The approach taken by SaltStack is to use a [Vagrant environment][]
starting up a master and two minion servers. Simply great and I'm now even using
that same environment while creating my first formulas ðŸ˜Š

If you're looking for more, you might also enjoy [Vault][]'s interactive
tutorial which gives you a quick crash course to the secret-store with a
web-based shell!

If you know of more such interactive courses, please let me know!
