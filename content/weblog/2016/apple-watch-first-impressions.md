About two years ago, when Apple released their first smartwatch, I was pretty
sure I wouldn't get it any time soon. I had recently been burnt by Android Wear
and didn't think Apple's competitor could be that much better justifying the big
price difference.

Then, in September or October I started too look into smartwatches again. The
concept was still very appealing to me since I'm on a bike basically every day
and having a notification and navigation interface available without having to
get my phone out at every corner was great with Android Wear. What drove me away
from that was mostly quality concerns on every level. The hardware was mediocre
as was the software.

So I read up about the new newer Pebble Watches (also does that had just
completed the latest Kickstarter at that time) and [Apple Watches][]. And it
would have been quite a hard decision were the new [Pebble Time 2][] available
now. I had also seen the Series 1 Apple Watch thanks to a friend and therefore
knew mostly what I was getting myself into and for that and a handful of other
reasons opted to go with Apple's product.

A little over a week ago I finally got my Apple Watch Series 2. Naively, I opted
to install all the apps I had on my phone also onto my watch. That made for a
really bad first impression as while the watch kept running for at least 18
hours, it drained my phone within 6 hours (which normally lasts for 2 days). I
hadn't thought about that but once I had removed all the apps that I didn't want
on the watch anyway, thinks improved significantly.

Now, the watch's battery lasts for about 4 days and doesn't affect the phone at
all anymore. After 2-3 days I also finally started to understand the activity
meters and am really enjoying them. They kind of feel like a more wholistic
approach to the step-counter by Fitbit I've been carrying around for the last
couple of years. There are some articles out there that try to explain the
differences but for me it simply boils down to "stand up" meaning standing up
and moving about ðŸ˜‰

Weirdly enough, I haven't used the Overcast remote app all the much so far, but
it's pretty much what I wanted so far. That's also a nice summary of the watch
so far. It is extremely well-made on the hardware side while the software is
good. There are some things I'd have liked to be handled differently mostly
related to the mail app, but only minor things.

In general, though, I'm very happy with it. A rugged version would be awesome,
though ðŸ˜‰ I thought about getting one of the cases available but none are
optimised for the Series 2 so water all of a sudden becomes an issue
again. Well, perhaps next year ðŸ˜Š
