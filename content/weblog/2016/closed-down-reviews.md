title: Closed down reviews

A couple of days I had one of those evenings where I was watching a TV show and
in parallel started looking up the places I visited while in the city that this
episode was taking place in (for the curious among you it was Daredevil and
therefore NYC).

It's only been [4 years][nyc] but much has changed since then. The hotel I slept
in [doesn't exist anymore][pac] nor do the Wendy's next door nor the diner
around the corner. Back then I really liked TripAdvisor and wrote a couple of
reviews on that trip as well as while being in Florence for EuroPython that
year. Now that some of the places I reviewed have closed down, the reviews seem
no longer to be there.

Actually, TripAdvisor doesn't delete the reviews, it just makes them nearly
completely inaccessible. Only if you have a [direct link][dl] to a review you
might have a chance to get to a list of other reviews. If the venue was removed
from the service (as was the case with the Pan American Hotel in Elmhurst), not
even a direct link will help.

TripAdvisor is probably not the only service that just blocks every review that
exists for closed locations but it is definitely another reason for me to write
even more of these reviews on my own blogs. These posts contain memories of some
great evenings that I really don't want to lose; something I should have known
from the very beginning, but somehow forgot.

I'm even considering updating old posts when I find out that a venue has been
closed down and/or what became of it. What I'm not sure about yet, is how to
deal with old these old reviews. Perhaps I will just create a subsection in my
travelogue for them, or do a simple data dump onto Github, or something else
entirely. Let's see ðŸ˜‰
