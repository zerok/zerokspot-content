A couple of weeks ago I already wrote about [the writing day at WriteTheDocs
Europe 2016][wt], but I totally forgot about writing about the conference that
followed it. Not writing about a documentation conference would be a shame, so
here we go ðŸ˜‰

What amazes me again and again with WTD events is how welcoming and diverse they
are. Pretty much every part of the industry (and industries) needs well-made
documentation on basically every level, and that's also where all the people you
meet there are coming from. Developers, technical writers, managers, founders,
... you name them. That also reflected in the talks, which were once again
great! From tips on how to get better learning foreign languages, over getting
inspiration from literature and how documentation and support can better work
together all the way to handling documentation in huge communities.

Honestly, this time I really can't pick my favorite talk, so I'll just post a
link to the [speakers page][sp] here, where you can also get to the talk
recordings.

The [venue][ac], this time around, was a bit outside the touristy part of Prague
right next to the central station. This made it far easier to reach but also a
bit less spectacular. Something that was corrected during the conference party
which once again took place at [Klub LÃ¡vka][kl], right below Charles
Bridge. Basically anything around the conference was very well organised. There
was even excellent breakfast and I finally got a place at one of the
front-tables on both conference days! The session slots were also just of the
right length as was the programme for each day.

This way Ulrich, Martina, and I could even do a bit site-seeing while there was
still daylight. There wasn't a chance to get into the castle buildings but
St. Vitus Cathedral was also from the outside amazing! And we found some great
restaurants and bars along the way ([Las Adelitas][la] and [LokÃ¡l Hamburk][lh]
in KarlÃ­n). One of the things we didn't get around, though, shopping at a
Captain Candy ðŸ˜‰

Getting back to the conference, perhaps the only thing that wasn't amazing was
the WiFi but that's whining on a high level ðŸ˜Š A big *Thank You* again to the
organisers for all their hard work!  I'll definitely be back. In fact, I already
started preparing for WriteTheDocs US 2017 ðŸ˜‰
