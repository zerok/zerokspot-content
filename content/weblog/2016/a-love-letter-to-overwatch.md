title: A love-letter to Overwatch
---

Now to something completely different: After quite some time I finally played
something on my PC again (and am actually surprised that it runs as well as it
does): Blizzard's [Overwatch][].

Dear Blizzard,

I'm usually not someone who enjoys competitive play all that much. I'm not all
that good at it and I don't see myself spending enough time to change
that. There are simple too many other things I love to do (reading books,
watching TV shows, listening to podcasts, ...).

Overwatch is different. The match-making is good enough that I never faced a
group in the quick matches (competitive mode without ranking) that my team
couldn't compete with. Another aspect is that the supporting characters are
really great to play as. Over the last ~50 hours of playtime I've spent most
playing as [Mercy][], the Swiss guardian angel who can heal team mates and
revive them if necessary. At first I was afraid that people would treat healers
as kind of a third leg, getting in the way of actually getting the objectives
done.

Funny enough, the one time I got heat so far was from the other team when I kept
keeping my team alive (or reviving a whole bunch of them when I came too late)
over and over again ðŸ˜ƒ High praise, then! Some probably even voted for me in the
post-match screen (another feature that I absolutely love!).

At first I was a bit weary of getting into the actual competitive mode for the
same reason, but even there healers are completely accepted! I still don't play
all that many ranked matches, though, simply because I enjoy the loose
atmosphere in the quick matches so much more.

I was also afraid that the few game-modes would get boring rather quickly. And
again you managed to proof me wrong! Every week the "Brawl" matches
[where the the rules are changed just a bit to make the matches that more interesting]
turn out to be tons of fun. Last week, for instance, you could only play as
[Ana][] or one of the tank heros. These have been some of the most entertaining
matches I've had so far ... and I think I finally got really good at playing
D.VA ðŸ˜Š

The whole cast of characters in general is just so great and diverse. Even after
50 hours I still haven't played more than a couple of minutes with most of them;
something that I definitely want to change. That "vs AI" mode is just perfect
for that. The AI is just tough enough that you can actually learn playing a
character without annoying the rest of your team. Sure, there are some
cry-babies like everywhere else, but they are very rare here (and muting them is
easy enough).

I guess, by now I don't have to write that I will keep playing Overwatch for a
long time to come ðŸ˜‰ I might even upgrade my PC again to make it look prettier
... the game, not that black box sitting to my right. A big THANK YOU to
everyone who has worked on this and please keep doing what you're doing. It
was awesome ðŸ˜ƒ
