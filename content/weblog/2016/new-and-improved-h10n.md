title: The new and improved h10n.me
---

I've had [h10n.me][] for quite some time now and my original plans for it were
to use it as a simple profile page; think [about.me][] but self-hosted. If I
write a page about me, I also want as much control over it as possible.

</figure>

The original page was simply a static HTML page that I updated only every now
and then. Two weeks ago I thought it might a great playground for [hugo][]. I've
used hugo before for my [travelogue][] but with this I'd try it for something
that isn't a blog. The end result is probably closer to what Derek Sivers has
done with [sivers.org][] than about.me: A page about who I am, what I'm doing,
and what I'm into right now that is frequently updated. For starters this means
a list of other web presences and books and podcasts that I'm currently
enjoying.

Hugo has worked wonderfully so far for that and thanks to it also supporting
rendering based on generated [data files][] there is probably a lot of
additional stuff coming in the future ðŸ˜‰ For now, you can find all the source
code (except for hugo itself) on [my github account][].

I also used this opportunity to give [Let's Encrypt][] a go; finally HTTPS
everywhere! On my travelogue I'm still fighting with Smugmug not yet supporting
HTTPS on custom domains, but I'm working on a solution there ðŸ˜Š
