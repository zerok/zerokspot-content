title: The e-book dilemma
---


I want an e-book reader! I really do, but it's not easy. There have
been devices for electronic books for many, many years now but the
whole story only started to become interesting when Amazon entered the
market and Sony finally put some useful devices out. For a few months now
I've started to only buy electronic technical books anymore simply because the
price of the paperbacks versions is killing me. Besides, it's kind of
useful to have full-text search on things like that ;-)

-----------------------

So a week ago when Amazon started shipping the [Kindle3](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P3M/ref=amb_link_353643142_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=0X0PZAE3WC33VZ0P0VZ4&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1273758762&pf_rd_i=507846), I really wanted to get
one and I still do. But there is a problem: All the books I have are either
PDFs or [EPUBs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB). And all the publishers I want to get books from publish PDFs
and EPUBs. So I have more or less two options right now:

1. Go with a Kindle (with its really gorgeous price tag) and use something like [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert all my books to .mobi or go with the PDFs or
2. get the new Sony PRS-650 when it comes out in a month for nearly double the price.

Luckily, this year's IFA was full of new e-book readers ranging from some
weird cooperations like [txtr + Asus](http://www.lesen.net/ereader/asus-ebook-store-kommt-von-txtr-3814/) (Asus couldn't find someone else, could
they), Thalia with their [Oyo](http://www.lesen.net/ereader/oyo-thalia-launcht-wifi-reader-fuer-139-euro-3835/) and iRiver showing off the [Cover Story](http://www.lesen.net/ereader/iriver-cover-story-kommt-zur-ifa-wi-fi-zur-buchmesse-3810/) as
well as Acer bringing out their own e-book reader. But honestly, so far only
the Sony device and the Kindle are real options for me.

While the Amazon device doesn't really support the format I want, the
community is large enough to get around this limitation. Also, Amazon is
effectively the one source for printed books for me. I think it's been nearly two
years now that I've bought a book somewhere else (not counting conferences)
and before that it was nearly 10 years. So *if* I'm ever tempted to buy
something DRM'd it would be from Amazon, not Thalia and don't even get me
started on txtr.

That said, buying DRM'd content is a last resort and a way I don't have to
take right now. Only, once I want also get all my Star Trek books online, I
effectively have to go with Amazon. The whole Adobe DRM scheme is simply too
smelly for me.

But why no iPad? Simple: The iPad is too large and too heavy. While I really
applaud Apple on supporting EPUB *and* combined with the Kindle app having the
most range of supported content, the price point is just way beyond the
sweet-spot for me. Those 139 USD are pretty much there. Even Sony's 250 EUR
is far more attractive than Apple's 500 EUR. Hm... I could buy a Kindle *and*
a Sony e-Reader ...

Why can't Amazon simply also provide EPUB support on the Kindle :-((( In the
end I'll probably just wait until October to see what's on the market after
[Frankfurt](http://www.buchmesse.de/de/fbm/).
