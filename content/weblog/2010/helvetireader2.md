title: Helvetireader 2.0 released
---


Getting tired of always the same old Google Reader interface greeting you in the morning? That or do you just don't like its look? Well, Jon Hicks recently released a new version of his Userscript powered alternative theme for Google's feed reader called [Helvetireader](http://helvetireader.com/), which is hopefully more to your liking :-) All you need is Firefox + Greasemonkey, Chrome, Safari + Greasekit or Opera and you can use it in just a few clicks.

I started using it two days ago and so far I really enjoy that simple look and feel. All I'm missing is the rendering of the like-counter, but given that it's just some CSS I could probably add it by myself in just a couple of lines ;-) Back in 2007 I was already using [one of Jon Hick's themes](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme) and stuck with it for a really long time (until I started moving between browsers again and kind of forgot about it) and this new one definitely looks promising enough to have the same long-term impact on me :-)
