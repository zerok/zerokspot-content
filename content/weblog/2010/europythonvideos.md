With every conference each attended faces at least once the problem that there
are multiple interesting talks you'd like to attend at the same time. Since
splitting yourself is still not an option (although, I'm pretty sure that
someone is working really hard on solving that problem right now) I'm always
extremely happy when I see some sort of video equipment in the session rooms
since then I can probably watch all these missed talks later on.

And now I can finally watch for instance the Guardian talk I missed at
