title: As long as I have my Radio...
---


Seems like big changes are going on over at Last.fm. When I read the [headline
on Mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/04/12/lastfm-streaming/) I first was
pretty scared, since I'm a paying subscriber and thought that Last.fm would kill
all of their streaming ... and Spotify is still not available in Austria.

But then I read the quote and the [post on Last.fm's
blog](http://blog.last.fm/2010/04/12/yes-it-does) again and noticed the term
"on-demand track streaming". Puhhh, lucky :-) It's not like this was available
to me anyway (remember, I pay for that service). Now I can just hope that they
don't get any funny ideas over there in London and also abandon the rest of
their streaming services (like the Radio!!!).

In the meantime, though, I can start feeling less cheated, since people from the
US, UK and Germany now no longer get there track-streaming from Last.fm anymore,
either ;-) On the other hand, I'm all for integrating other services like [The Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/) (which I hadn't heard of before) since more services simply mean more great new music to me :-)
