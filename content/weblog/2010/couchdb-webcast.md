title: CouchDB webcast tomorrow
---


Just read on
[CouchIO](http://blog.couch.io/post/535921455/couchdb-webcast-tomorrow) that
[Chris Anderson](http://jchrisa.net/), author of [CouchDB: The Definitive
Guide](http://books.couchdb.org/relax/) will host a [webcast
tomorrow](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/e/1588) about some of the details behind
the database system.

According to the post this will even become a monthly thing, something that
should really improve the available documentation (be it via text or
screencasts) for Couch. Thinking about it ... I have to wonder if this might not
also be great as a video podcasts for on the go :D

I doubt that I will be able to attend but at least O'Reilly seems to be quite
thorough when it comes to [putting these webcasts up on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/oreillymedia#p/c/30603FE448DB8FA1).
