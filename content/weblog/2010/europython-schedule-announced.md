And finally there is a [timetable](http://www.europython.eu/talks/timetable/)
available for this year's [EuroPython](http://www.europython.eu/) conference
in Birmingham this July.  And it will be quite packed: Four days full of talks
about tools like [eventlet](http://eventlet.net/) and
[twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) and literally a whole day for testing
techniques alone :D But not only are the topics great, the list of speakers is
highly impressive as well with Guido van Rossum, Mark Ramm, Raymond Hettinger
and Andrew Godwin, just to name a few. Combined with an awesome venue and two
sprint days this is going to be a truly great week :-)
