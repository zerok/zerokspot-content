title: 2 Years of GitHub
---


It's unbelievable that it's only been [2 years since GitHub
launched](http://github.com/blog/40-we-launched). And what has all happened
since then... More and more projects are leaving the dark days of centralized
systems behind in favour of a more open approach. If you think about it, it's
been [5 years since Google Code
launched](http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2005/03/google-code-progress-report.html)
so GitHub is still relatively new but it definitely doesn't feel that way. Back
then it was also way more of a revolution than an evolution if you compare it to
Google Code vs. Sourceforge.

Nowadays, sites like [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) start to feel - at least for me - like the
central [hub of the opensource community](http://github.com/explore). The place
where you find new and interesting projects and where you can easily contribute.
And btw.: They even have a [podcast](http://changelogshow.com/) ;-)

[Happy birthday, GitHub](http://github.com/blog/637-happy-2nd-birthday-github)
