title: A pause for WeeklyResearch
---


Due to some hardware issues with my MBP and the start of the Battlefield 4 Beta I didn't find the time to prepare a topic for last week. And next week I'll be on vacation, so probably again no WeeklyResearch post. That being said, the last 5 weeks were quite exhausting but also a lot of fun digging a little deeper into semi-random topics (basically those that I just stumbled onto while looking into something else) and I definitely want to continue that. Perhaps doing 5 in a row and then taking a little break will set the right pace here :-)
