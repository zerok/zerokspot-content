It took quite a while this time around but finally there is something official about this year's EuroPython: The conference will take place July 1 - 7. No venue has been announced yet but I'd assume it is once again the *Grand Hotel Mediterraneo* near the Arno. I certainly hope so since this would mean our favorite river bar is once again just across the street ;-)

The [conference's website](https://ep2013.europython.eu/) is still pretty empty but with the date finally out this is just a matter of time. According to Giovanni Bajo's [announcement on the mailing-list](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2013-January/008204.html) the call for proposals will happen on February 1st.
