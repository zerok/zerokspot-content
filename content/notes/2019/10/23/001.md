This morning was probably the best advertising for biking in Graz one
could imagine. Due to a technical difficulty one of the tunnels around
Graz, the Plabutschtunnel, was
[closed](https://steiermark.orf.at/stories/3018409/) and all major
roads in the South and West of the city were basically
congested. There was a traffic jam from South of Zentralfriedhof all
the way up to the main railway station (~ 3.8km). The bike lanes were
empty ðŸ˜‰
