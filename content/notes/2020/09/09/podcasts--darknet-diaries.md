> Darknet Diaries is a podcast about cyber-security and in general hacking even if the term should be cracking. The show provides a lot of great stories about the world scene and how individual persons, groups like Anonymous or even states break into systems all over the globe.

That sounds pretty much up my alley 😁 Once I have my podcast backlog under control again, I'll definitely give the [Darkweb Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) a try!
