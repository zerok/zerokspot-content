> Last Thursday, I was locked out of my cloud MDM, my data was deleted, and MDM agents for every device @trailofbits were silently removed by the vendor, leaving the entire company unmanaged. There was no advance notice and no explanation.

So basically the MDM company Kandji first did the marketing dance, then gave support during the migration of a company's device inventory, and then unilaterally cancelled the contract and thereby killing all enrolled devices? If that was really the case, they might be in for a legal rideâ€¦
