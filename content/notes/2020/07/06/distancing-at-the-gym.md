Just came back from my local gym. Up until last week every second exercise device was taped off enforcing distance between people. All that tape is gone now. Given that the numbers have been rising in Austria for the last two weeks I don't get why they did that but will definitely ask them ASAP. For some reason I didn't ask at the gym itself ðŸ˜©
