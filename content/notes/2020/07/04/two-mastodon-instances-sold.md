> From a message by Joshua Strobl I noticed that Mastodon.cloud had changed owners. On their frontpage I read that the same is true for the bigger mstdn.jp instance (and their about page confirms that). 

I'm curious if there was any communication to registered users *other than* the posts by TheAdmin. While sending out a notice more than 30 days before the move sounds fine, as a user I'd be worried if such changes weren't also communicated via e-mail or private message.
