That's pretty much also my opinion of certifications. In this case, I mostly did them because I wanted to get some deeper but also broader knowledge about the whole stack and doing an exam in the end was the incentive to stick with it until the end.

It's still just a snapshot and I absolutely agree with you that having a cert doesn't automatically make you into an expert. People collecting certs like Pok√©mon without actually working with those technologies in the long run are IMO doing the exams for the wrong reasons.
