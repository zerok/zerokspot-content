Didn't he say that they *won't* run ads but instead integrate a payment system for additional features? That being said, I haven't yet found the primary source for that quote but just articles e.g. by [DerStandard.at](https://zerokspot.com/notes/2020/12/23/telegram-will-add-paid-features/) (normally quite reliable) and didn't care to dig too deep since I don't use Telegram but focus on Signal and Matrix.
