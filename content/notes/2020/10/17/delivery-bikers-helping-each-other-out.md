While waiting at my favourite burger place yesterday two bikers from two different delivery services (let's call them A and B) arrived to pick up their respective orders. Right after one (A) left the other noticed that there was a bundle left and asked if it belonged to him (B) order the other guy (A). The waiter hadn't seen that forgotten bundle and B didn't think much, grabbed the bundle, and ran after A. Such a small gesture but it was just great to see people helping each other even though they were working for competitors!
