It's rare that I enjoy a TV spot but this one for the German supermarket chain Netto. It's based on an outburst by the former Italien football coach [Giovanni Trapattoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Trapattoni) from 1998 in which he criticised the performance of his team at the time (FC Bayern München) with the words "ware' schwach wie eine Flasche leer. Ich habe fertig." ("They were weak like an empty bottle. I'm done." just in broken German).

The Netto spot now uses that quote when talking about reusable bottles when someone watching TV notices that his bottle is empty.
