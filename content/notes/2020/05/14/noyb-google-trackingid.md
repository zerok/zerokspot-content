Yesterday, noyb filed a formal GDPR complaint against Google because of the Tracking ID not being deletable and it being opt-out instead of opt-in. This way, users are not able to give their consent *before* being tracked. I'm really curious if they will succeed here.

iOS also has a ["Limit Ad Tracking"][l] checkbox hidden inside the privacy settings and I cannot remember if it is enabled by default. If not then wouldn't such a complaint also be valid here?
