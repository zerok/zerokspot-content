I had only heard that [Bad Boys 3](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boys_for_Life) was supposed to be good but when I saw a trip-pack of all three movies in one box I simply had to get it. I expect good popcorn cinema and I got exactly that! Mike is still awesome and Marcus still annoying but funny. Combined with the right amount of action the movie was just a joy to watch! High-budget action at its best!
