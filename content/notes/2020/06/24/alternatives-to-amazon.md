I'm quite deep in the Apple ecosystem and have been for nearly 15 years now ðŸ™‚ I just recently started to code some smaller things like Swift, though, and so WWDC finally got interesting for me ðŸ˜…

As far Amazon: I can get most books also via [Morawa.at](https://www.morawa.at) or [Thalia](https://www.thalia.at/shop/home/show/) but if an ebook is only available DRM'd then I pick the Kindle-version simply because Adobe DRM is just so much worse than anything else I've had to deal with. In this particular case, though, I went with Amazon because my local bookstore told me that they weren't even sure that they'd get it. I try to avoid Amazon but sometimes it's just too convenient ðŸ˜£

Video games I at least try to get on [gameware.at](https://www.gameware.at/) first.
