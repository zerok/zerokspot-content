~5â‚¬ per month is awesome! Didn't know that Cloudflare also had a DNS offering ðŸ™‚ 

To be fair, I could probably move away from Spaces in favour of something like S3 or Google Cloud Storage but I really like the usability of pretty much everything that DigitalOcean provides ðŸ˜… Also: the 6$ for Spaces is completely optional right now. I *should* have enough disk space available on the VPS but I wanted to plan ahead a bit so that I don't have to move everything once I start putting series amounts of photos on there ðŸ¤£
