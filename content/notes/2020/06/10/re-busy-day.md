> Apart from using Zoom, being in that kind of meetings is wrong. It's everything but not productive. You got a lot of noise from mics not muted and you get people trying to speak simultaneously. I can't even understand what some guys think : “Hey let's put a maximum of employees there to nail that issue down!”

Any meeting beyond 15 people has to be moderated with raising hands etc. If you don't do that the risk of chaos is just too high.

That being said: the mic discipline has improved quite a lot since everything started in March. By now most attendees of my university lectures and workshops know to join muted. WebEx not supporting push-to-talk doesn't help, though.
