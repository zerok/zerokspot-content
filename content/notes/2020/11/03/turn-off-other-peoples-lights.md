Yesterday we rod to IKEA to buy some boxes. Just before exiting the building again I noticed that I had forgotten to turn of my bike's lights.
When we got back to our bikes and my lights were off I was pretty sure they had run out of battery.

Turns out, someone had walked by, noticed the lights and turned them off for me! Such a small gesture but it saved me from having to drive home in the dark! Thank you!
