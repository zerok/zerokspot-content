> Der ehemalige Innenminister und nunmehrige FPÖ-Klubchef Herbert Kickl habe die Operation „Ramses“ vergangene Woche an die Öffentlichkeit „geleakt“ und sie in Verbindung mit dem Terroranschlag in der Wiener City gestellt.

There were multiple police raids in Austria today against Muslim Brotherhood. Somehow former interior minister Herbert Kickl had knowledge about these before they happened and actually leaked some information about them putting them in relation with the attack in Vienna last Monday. Turns out, that relation didn't exist. There are now investigations going on about how Kickl was able to learn about these raids.
