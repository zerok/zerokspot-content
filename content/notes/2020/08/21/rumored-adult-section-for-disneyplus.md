I'm currently thinking really hard about cancelling my Disney+ subscription at the end of the current billing period but this might make the service interesting again. So far I've only seen 3 shows that I actually want to watch there:

- Duck Tales
- Mandalorian
- Tron: Uprising

With the more recent Disney movies not being available on it it's simply not a good deal right now.
