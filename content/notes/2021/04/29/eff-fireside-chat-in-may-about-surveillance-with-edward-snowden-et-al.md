Next week (Wednesday, 2021-05-05 at 19:00 UTC) there's going to be an EFF Fireside Chat about surveillance with  Edward Snowden, EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn, EFF Director of Engineering for Certbot Alexis Hancock, and EFF Policy Analyst Matthew Guariglia. Sadly, I most likely won't be able to make it but this sounds awesome!
