[Element](https://element.io/) is now offering a new hosting plan including a dedicated Matrix home server with custom and 5 accounts for $10 per month. That's actually quite a nice offering in case you don't want to invest the time in setting up and maintaining your own server and still want to get yourself and your family onto Matrix with their own domain.
