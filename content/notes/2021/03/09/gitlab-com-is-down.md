[GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/) is mostly down right now and on [#3875](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3875) people post crap like "We are trying to do a prod deployment now..." ... not helping!

In general, I wouldn't want to be their OPS team during the last month with their shared runners acting up and now this.
