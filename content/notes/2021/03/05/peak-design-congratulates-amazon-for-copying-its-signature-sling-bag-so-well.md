Peak Design has released a humorous video highlighting the main differences between their Everyday Sling bag and Amazon's. As someone who has that product by Peak Design, even looking at the straps of the clone just hurts. It's like it had been designed to look in the front like Peak Design's bag but everything that makes the Everyday Sling a great bag has been left out.
