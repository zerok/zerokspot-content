A couple of months ago the Austrian Economic Chamber in cooperation with the Austrian government launched a [portal](https://www.kaufhaus-oesterreich.at/) that what supposed to make it easier for everyone to find regional stores. Turns out, the offered functionality wasn't what people wanted and its costs didn't help popular opinion either. 

Now, it's unclear if and in what form the platform will be continued. I guess that's € 600K well spent...
