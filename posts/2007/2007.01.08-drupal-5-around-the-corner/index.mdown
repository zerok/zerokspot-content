# Drupal 5 around the corner

At least it seems this way according to [this mail](http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2007-01/msg00217.html) by Dries Buytaert. And even if there will be an RC3, I can't wait to update this site to Drupal 5 after all I've seen on [gamerslog.com](http://gamerslog.com) so far.

Yesterday I also noticed, that there is now finally also a new version of the [Akismet port for Drupal](http://drupal.org/project/akismet) out, and that it also seems to support Drupal 5, which was one of the last modules I absolutely need for zerokspot.
