# Digg Podcast approval ...

<img src="{uploads}/digg.waitingforapproval.png" alt="" class="left"/>11 days ago the first [official phpBB podcast](http://podcast.phpbb.com/) was released to the net.

... and am still waiting for approval. Somehow I start to wonder if I've done anything wrong there. Do I have to perform a special dance? Send some beer to Kevin? I don't know :-) IMO the current policy there is way too slow. It's understandable why they want to have a different policy for podcasts than for news stories, esp. when you consider that they actually also let you listen to the podcasts' episodes and therefor have to periodically check for updates. But the current way of handling submissions is still way too slow.

Why not just show the podcast itself and only add episodes after it reached a certain threshold of diggs? Just an idea :-)
