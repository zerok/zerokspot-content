# Photowalk No.6

<a class="left" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/1659262256/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2315/1659262256_1e64045824_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="DSC_3858.jpg" /></a>Another month, [another photowalk](http://www.photowalk.at/2007/09/24/photowalk-6-colors-of-autumn/). This time with a topic suiting the season ("Colors of Autumn") and quite a few records and 2 dogs (with one being large enough to just run you down if you're not careful) ...

-------------------------------

First of all, we now have a new participants-record with IIRC 20 hobby- and professional photographers with tons of new faces, then we had by far the worst weather yet with about 5Â°C, wind and clouds and thanks to that this also probably was the shortest photowalk ;-)

The after-walk party took place at the Fischerwirt restaurant ... too bad we had to skip the dinner part since they only seem to serve food after 18:00 o'clock :-/

Anyway, just take a look at all the [photos](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/photowalkat201007/) shot today :D
