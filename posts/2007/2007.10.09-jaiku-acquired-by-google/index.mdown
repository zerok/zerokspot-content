# Jaiku acquired by Google

Now this is strange. I would have expected Nokia to buy them, but Google? Perhaps Twitter was not for sale, although I also didn't notice that [Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com) was. Anyway, it seems like this is one of those acquisitions where the buyer more or less locks the site down to integrate it completely into its own infrastructure (Writely anyone?). 

-------------------------------

Right after [announcing the acquisition](http://www.jaiku.com/blog/2007/10/09/were-joining-google/), Jaiku closed its registration and according to the [FAQ](http://jaiku.com/help/google):

> A limited number of users will be able to sign up for an invitation to participate in continued beta-testing of the service. 

So will Jaiku be renamed to Gaiku? Will we see a direct integration into GMail and Google Talk ... wait! There already is a Jabber Bot, so I guess the GTalk integration won't really be such a new thing. I'm really curious what the child of this union will look like, but I won't hold my breath.
