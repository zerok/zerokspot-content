# Opera now free

For the last couple of days there were rumors about a drastic change for Opera. Now it seems to be final: The Opera browser is free , but now also in the sense of ad-free ;-) Opera software today also releases version 8.50 which removes the banners, the registration open and some security problems. It also now comes with the <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/browserjs/">Browser Javascript</a> feature which makes it possible for Opera software to "fix" websites for the user by altering it using Javascript. It's as far as I can tell the "official way" of UserJS ;)
