# Hitachiverse...

Ok, this is more a running gag between a friend of mine and myself, but is there any market where Hitachi has no company??? I mean, they are producing hard disks, <a href="http://www.hcme.com/">forklift trucks</a>, <a href="http://www.hitachi.com/wwn/europe/link/hitachiaircon.html">air conditioning units</a>, <a href="http://www.hds.co.uk/">storage solutions</a> ... hell, <a href="http://www.hcdiagnostics.com/">allergy tests</a>.

I think you can imagine my suprise when I first say Hitachi forklift trucks during my military service. Until then I only knew Hitachi as an electronics company. It was for me like seeing hard disks produced by Nestlß©. <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/robots/hitachi-pal-and-chum-robots-036636.php">Now Hitachi seems also to build robots</a> \*g\*, strange looking ones, but anyway ;-) Perhaps this is just another step to the automated forklift truck and complete world domination ;-)
