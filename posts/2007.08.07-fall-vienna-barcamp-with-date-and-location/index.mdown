# Fall Vienna BarCamp with Date and Location

<img src="{uploads}/barcamp-small.png" alt="" class="left"/>The [next BarCamp in Vienna](http://www.barcamp.at/BarCamp_Vienna_September_2007) finally seems to have a date and a location. The event will take place on the 29th and 30th of September in the Microsoft Office ...

-------------------------------

With this date right before the start of the new semester it's definitely a nice way to let the vacations and the summer end this way. Right now the list of participants looks quite similar to the first Carinthian BarCamp last spring. Let's see if we can fill the whole building up :D 

Just stupid that the Ã–BB had to limit their summer ticket for pupils and students to July and August :-(.
