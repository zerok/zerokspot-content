# Microsoft Office 2004 Test Drive having a time problem?

Some short maths: I got my laptop IIRC on Nov. 24 bundled with a trial license for Microsoft Office 2004 valid for 30 days which should make it available to be up to Dec. 24. Well, today I wanted to make a PowerPoint presentation so I started PowerPoint .... and was greated by a message box telling me that my trial period is over. Now I really wonder, when my evaluation period effectively started ... the moment Apple started to assemble my laptop? When they put all these 1024x768 fireflies behind the glass? ... Stupid
