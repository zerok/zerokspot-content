# Orderning a new era for me ;)

This morning I did something I would have thought being impossible just a year ago: I ordered a Mac. Or to be precise one of the new Powerbooks 12". This whole process also included two phone calles with Apple Austria: The first call was about if I have to buy AppleCare right when buying the notebook if I want to have it later or if I can wait a little bit (no money left ;)) which was answered by a very friendly support staff member positively. Since the 2nd call was related to a small problem I had during ordering and this not being really a common problem I won't say the details but just this: Again really friendly support.

Now I just hope that I will get my Powerbook soon to finally being able to also program on and for Macs. Then I could program and test on all the major operating systems ;)
