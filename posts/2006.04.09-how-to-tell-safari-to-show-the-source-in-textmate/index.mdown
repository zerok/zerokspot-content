# How to tell Safari to show the source in TextMate?

If you know Safari you also know it's source viewer and probably hate it as much as I do. No decent syntax highlighting, no nothing. But there is a solution for our pain :D Well, it's not really a completely integrated solution but [Chris Biagini's AppleScript](http://assortedgeekery.com/scripts/ViewSourceinTM) is still a great solution (although I always activate it when I don't really need it ;)). Thanks Chris for making my life much easier :D
