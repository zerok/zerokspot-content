# New Year's Resolution 2011

I guess, I should really make one of these otherwise I will have one thing
less to feel bad about when 2011 comes to its end. So here we go:

* This was already inoffically already on my list for last year, but this year I
  really want to find some time to mess around with [Scala][scala] and [Lift][lift]. For
  some reason both really fascinate me without me actually knowing all that much
  about Lift. For Scala I can at least say that I've read about half a book
  so far :-P I just need to find myself a little pet project to use both and
  that I can't solve easily with Django or Flask.

* Last year was a bit of a bummer when it came to *photography*. After leaving
  Klagenfurt I've kind of forgotten how much fun just walking around and taking
  pictures can be. I really have to find some time and motivation for it
  again, especially now that I finally have a [Sun Sniper Steel][sss].

* *More Python*. That's basically it. Thanks to my job I hardly have any
  motivation to do lots of server-side coding in my spare time; aside from
  rewriting my personal blog again and again, of course ;-) This I definitely
  want to change. There is so much cool new stuff out there every week that I
  really don't want to miss.

* Just for my mother's sake I will also put "Do some sports" on this list
  ;-) Perhaps some table tennis would be nice again for some change, or
  getting a subscription at some Gym.

* Go to more meetups. Graz isn't really all that full of usergroups I'm
  interested in, but perhaps I've just missed some :-)

I originally also wanted to add ["Donate some money to PDPC"](http://freenode.net/pdpc_donations.shtml)
but I just did that a few minutes ago ;-)
