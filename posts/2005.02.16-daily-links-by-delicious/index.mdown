# "Daily links" by del.icio.us

I'm currently experimenting a little bit with the linkfeed service of del.icio.us that I've found thanks to <a href="http://www.pixelgraphix.de/archives/2005/01/links_for_20050.php">Daniela Hoffmann</a>. If I understand it correctly, this service will post through XMLRPC a list of new links every day. Let's see if this really works out :-)
