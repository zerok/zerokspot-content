# Python.org re-designed

Today I wanted to check the python documentation for some things to improve my little Technorati Cosmos script ... and fell nearly from my chair: [Python.org](http://www.python.org) in new and nice :D Just too bad that it's not valid HTML though. Also the transition seems to be quite far from complete. So has the whole documentation still the old layout and basically any deeper part of the site... well, I just hope, that they will also update the documentation style ;)
