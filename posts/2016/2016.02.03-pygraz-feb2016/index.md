# The slightly different PyGraz meetup

Yesterday evening we once again had our monthly [Python Usergroup Graz][pygraz]
meeting. This time it didn't take place at the [Spektral][], though, as at the
last second (well, a week ago...) a schedule collision happened and the nice
folks behind that association had to use that room for themselves. Luckily,
within a couple of hours we had found a new venue for that evening at the
[Realraum][]!  Big thanks to [Michael][] and everyone else who helped here!

So, what happened yesterday? We had two talks! I gave a short tour through some
of nice string-formatting mechanisms you have with Python, something I had
already written about [here][] a couple of weeks ago. As that blog post is
already quite detailed, I probably won't upload any slides this time around. If
you want to learn more, simply read that post and visit [pyformat.info][], which
contains many more examples ðŸ˜‰

Right after my talk, we had a quick introduction into some of the awesome things
you can do with [Pandas][]. Sadly, I don't yet have anything to link to here,
but I'll update this post as soon as I hear back from the presenter! Big thanks
to him too for giving the talk!

We also had three visitors from our [sibling usergroup in Vienna][vie] which
come by every once in a while and who have their
[next meetup incl. a coding dojo][pyv] on February 17 at the Metalab ðŸ˜Š

The next meetup in Graz will be on March 1 most likely again at the
Spektral. Official announcement will be made soonish on [Meetup.com][],
[our website][pygraz] and all the other nice places you can find us ðŸ˜ƒ
