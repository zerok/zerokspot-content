# This was WriteTheDocs 2016 for me

The first conference I attended during my trip to Portland for the last two
weeks was this year's edition of [WriteTheDocs NA][wtdna]. I been to the first
European WTD last year in Prague and absolutely wanted to see if the North
American sister-event could keep up with that. Yes it could ðŸ˜‰

---------

As was the case in Prague, the conference's attendees were mostly technical
writers but also a handful developers and other professions had found their way
to the [McMenamins Crystal Ballroom][cb].  Sadly, Ulrich and I couldn't be at
the sprints as our planes arrived late on Sunday but at least we could be there
in time for the main conference event ðŸ˜Š

Same as last September I learnt a lot about other companies approaches to
documentation and general best practices for improving all aspects of it. One
big point was that gathering as much analytics data about and feedback from
your readers and customers is extremely important to be able to set the right
priorities. Even simple like/don't like indicators can help a great deal but the
more information the better ([Betsy Roseberg][] and [Brianne Hillmer][]).

Later [Thursday Bram][] drew some comparisons between writing documentation and
writing fiction as everyone enjoys a good story and bringing emotions into the
text help readers connect. On the other hand, "documentation is not a place for
plot twists". It usually also helps to provide a recommended reading order while
still allowing users to find their own path if they want to.


According to [Ruthie BenDor][] the style of your documentation also depends
heavily on why you documenting and for what audience. Blog posts,
show-and-tells, they all have their places but try to avoid splitting your
documentation into too many places just because one author found that tool
convenient while another preferred a different tool altogether. Also: Re-evaluate
your methods regularly!

Earlier I had learnt from [Britta Gustafson][] that the US government has a
couple of supporting agencies among them 18F which specialises in IT consulting
and publishes tons of tools and documents through
[Github](https://github.com/18f). It's hard to imagine the amount of excitement
that Britta showed for her work coming from an Austrian government
employee. Perhaps in the next generation ðŸ˜‰

When it comes to tools I learnt about [Slate][], which can be used for
documenting APIs, and [YarnSpinner][] which should help you keep your dialog
structures in order and is used for multiple game projects right now.

Well, these are my main take-aways from the main event. Let's talk now a little
bit about everything surrounding it.

First: The venue. As the name implies, it was a ballroom, very open and with
lots of places to either talk with people or stand/sit and enjoy the talks. The
first couple of rows has round table where people could work on stuff while
listing to the speakers, which was a really nice touch. Perhaps the only thing I
didn't like about the place was the floor, which speaks against using ballrooms
as conference venues. You really feel it when someone walks to their seat ðŸ˜‰

On Monday the conference also featured a social evening event taking place in
the [Jackknife][], a really nice bar just a few minutes away from the conference
venue with a decent selection of beers and cocktails. A great opportunity to get
to know more of the folks there ðŸ™‚

In general the event was very intimate. There was nothing separating the
speakers from their audience after their respective talks. They were simply part
of the same big community. For me personally it's the perfect event to find help
with improving what I care a lot about: documentation and making it easier for
new people to use what I and others have built. I can't imagine a more welcoming
place for that. A big THANK YOU to all the organisers, speakers, and helpers who
made this possible!

Will I come again? Well, I'm pretty sure I will be able to attend
[WTD Europe][wtdeu16] later that year ðŸ˜‰

Btw.: Videos of most if not all of the talk are already [online][]!
