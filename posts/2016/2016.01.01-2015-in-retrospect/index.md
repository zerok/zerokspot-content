# 2015 in Retrospect

Wow, 2015 is already over and it once again feels like one of these years were I
didn't get anything done. But, luckily, that's not completely true as I noticed
while writing this post. I learnt a lot, went to a lot of great places and had
fun. I was also fortunate enough that there were no accidents or family
incidents this year with any mid- to long-term effects. Fingers crossed for next
year.

## Conference & Travel Season

Just like in previous years, I've tried to combine exploring cities I haven't
been to before (or not recently) with interesting conferences. As I've started
to move a bit away from Python as my main focus I've also started to go to a
more diverse set of conferences. That I heard great talks and met extremely
interesting people at all these events goes without saying, ... but I just said
it anyway üòä

I went to a ton of events I hadn't been before:

* [FOSDEM][] (in Brussels)
* [JSConf Budapest][jsconfbp]
* [PolyConf][poc] (in Poznan)
* [WriteTheDocs][] (in Prague)
* Django under the Hood (in Amsterdam)
* Chaos Congress (in Hamburg)

but also to a couple of good old friends:

* [PyCon US][pyc] (in Montr√©al üòâ followed by a trip to Chicago)
* [DjangoCon Europe][dce] (in Cardiff)
* dotGo (in Paris)

Most of them I also plan to attend again perhaps with the exception of PolyConf
which is simply to far outside of what is useful to me right now. I was
especially blown away by the larger community events in this list: FOSDEM and
Congress. Both had been on my radar for ages but I had never managed to go there
before. Not so last year and I've already added them to my list of "must-go
events". Just think about it: The Congress had about 13,000 attendees and more
than 1,000 helpers!

On these trips I went to many cities I had never visited before and so I started
a dedicated travel blog ([travelogue][tl]) in April for all the sight-seeing,
hotel- and restaurant-reviews. For some reason I forgot to document trips made
during the last 4-5 months but I will hopefully get around filling these holes
in the next weeks. That and change the theme and update that thing as a
whole. That being said, [Hugo][] has worked really well there so far and I plan
to do more with this site (like including maps etc.) and possibly Hugo in
general.


## Technology and Languages

It comes with the job that a big focus for me are programming languages, the
tools I use, and technology in general. Last October I finally made the move
back to using 100% iOS on my mobile devices simply because of OmniFocus and the
camera on the iPhone 6s (and some minor other tools) as detailed [here][ios].

When it comes to programming languages the downwards trend for Python and me has
continued. For most of the things I write, Go and JavaScript with Node.js are
simply better fits but for small tools and simply brainstorming an idea Python
is still my language of choice. It's just too comfortable for extracting data
from Excel sheets, for instance.

I've also tried to get into some newer languages like Elixir and Clojure but
nothing has stuck so far. Elixir looked extremely promising to me but for now
it's simply not a good fit and I don't enjoy Erlang OTP all that much. Clojure
might be more along my alley, though. And don't get me started on Haskell (which
I also at least read a book about this year). This was so far away from what I
want to code in, I can't find the right words üòâ

When it comes to web-frontend technologies I've finally had time to work more
with React.JS and absolutely loved it. Especially when combined with Redux I had
tons of fun and am really looking forward to doing more with it in 2016. These
two were also the two pieces of software that impressed me the most last
year.


## Life, Health, and everything else

Health-wise I feel better than ever. Over the last 2-3 years I've lost about
20kg and changed my daily routine (at least on work-days) to include walking
home from work or riding a bike in both directions no matter the weather.

What I'm not yet happy with is my fanatism when it comes to software
craftsmanship. Counteracting this with chocolate only works so far üòâ I really have
to work on that and I will!


## Review of the goals for 2015

So did I manage to at least complete some of the goals I had set out to do
[last year][goals]?

* More JavaScript: I definitely did more JavaScript, also in my spare-time. I'm
  actually quite happy with the mix I code in right now, so I see that as a ‚úì
* Doing some Django again: Yes, I've worked with Django again but not enough for
  my liking. Esp. with the upcoming [channels][ch] I want to do more again and
  perhaps be more active in the community. ‚ùå
* More blogging. ‚úì
* More weekend trips: To some degree managed that thanks to Django under the
  Hood, dotGo, FOSDEM et al. ‚úì
* Only spare-time project I enjoy: ‚úì

4 out of 5, not bad üòä

But this post has already become too long so I will write about my goals for
2016 another time. Happy new year, everyone! üòÉ
