# Trains, a magical place

... OK, not in the sense of how this term is used in "The Agents of
Shield". That would be horrible. No, I mean as a magical place to get work
done. Yesterday I went to Vienna in order to visit two friends (and restock in
sweets). Over the last couple of years I've grown to absolutely love the
train-ride there simply because it gives me around three hours of nearly
uninterrupted concentration time per direction and has ended up as probably
*the* place for me to get work done.

Surely, you say, I could have the same at home at my work-desk, but what makes
these rides so special for me are the constraints there. I can't just simply
stand up and start playing video games or buy groceries. All I can do there is
what is possible either using my laptop, my tablet, or my phone. Given the
limited reception on some parts of the track between Graz and Vienna, my options
are even more limited, so losing too much time on YouTube is rarely an option.

[Railjets][railjet] in Austria are particularly nice as even in the second class
you get at least one power outlet for every two seats and even in the
two-seaters the foldable tray is nearly at the perfect distance between the
passenger and the next row. I even stopped looking at first-class seats simply
because they ended up offering too much leg-room which made working far less
comfortable ðŸ˜‰

So, yesterday I managed to get all the work I had planned for the whole weekend
done in about 4 hours all while being on the train to and from Vienna. That
allowed me to waste all of Sunday on season 2 of Overwatch and Elementary ðŸ˜Š
