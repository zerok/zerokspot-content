# Superhot

So, [Superhot][] is finally out and thanks to being on the
[Kickstarter campaign][kickstarter] back in early 2014 I didn't even have to go
the long way through Steam to get it (I took the even longer route, I guess) ðŸ˜‰
But I have to say, it was well worth the wait.

Back then I first saw the [teaser on Giantbomb][gb] more two years ago, that mix
of being a first-person-shooter and a puzzle game was already extremely
fascinating and I knew I'd really like to play this eventually. The finished
game is even more a puzzler than I had expected. As with the demo, time is
extremely slowed down when you're not moving (looking around seems to speed time
up by a little) so you can see where the enemies hidden in each level are
shooting at.

-------

Goal of every highly stylized black-and-white level is to take out all the red
enemies. Most of the time you start without any weapon but your adversaries can
have pistols, assault rifles, baseball bats, or (the highlight) katanas. You can
get these from them by throwing things at them or taking the "reds" out via
melee attacks. In the end every level looks like a choreography of you
approaching a red, throwing something at him to get his weapon, taking out a
couple others with that weapon until its empty, and repeat. The trick here is to
find the right order and tactic to do that without being hit even once. You can
also jump but - for some reason - this is only used once.

That gameplay is surrounded by a short and still well made story about hacking,
addiction, but the star here is the time-mechanic. Once you're done with the 2-3
hours of story, an endless-mode opens up which lets you use all the skills
you've learnt to their absolute limit.

You might think that â‚¬20 for 2-to-3-hours campaign is quite a tough sell, but
when combined with the endless-mode it is well worth it ðŸ˜ƒ So far I've finished
the campaign and a small chunk of the endless-mode and I can definitely see
myself returning to this over and over again. The time-mechanic is just so
great! Will I upload tons of stuff to [killstagram.com][]? Most likely not, but
don't see that as an indicator that I've stopped playing ðŸ˜‰
