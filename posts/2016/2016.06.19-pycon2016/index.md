# PyCon 2016 in a nutshell

It's taking me longer and longer to write these conference posts but least I
finally found the time for this one: Welcome to my little write-up of
[PyCon 2016][] üòâ

So, PyCon 2016 took place at the end of May, just a few days after
[WriteTheDocs][wtd], in the beautiful Oregon Convention Centre in Portland. That
place is huge, although probably a bit smaller than last year's venue in
Montr√©al. The session rooms were, again, spread throughout the whole complex
which made reaching my step-count each day perhaps a bit too easy.

----------------


## Pre-show

Same as in previous years I had opted to skip the workshops and let my
conference experience begin with the goodie-bag stuffing (or "stuff bagging" as
I often accidentally referred to it). The process was even more fine-tuned this
time around. If you've never been there, it is basically a looooong table with
all sorts of swag on and people around it ready to hand them out. Then another
group of people each having a goodie-bag goes around that table to receive the
actual goodies. This time 3,294 badges have been issued so there were quite a
few bags to fill.

Anyway, 2.5 hours later everything was done and we were ready
for the evening reception to meet the sponsors and some light meals üòâ


## Conference days

The next three days were full of awesome keynotes, sessions and lighting
talks. Just to give you a short overview, these were just the talks *I* went to:

Day 1:

* [Thinking in Coroutines][co] ≈Åukasz Langa
* [When the going gets tough, get TUF going][tuf] by Ying Li, David Lawrence
* [Designing secure systems with Object-Capabilities, Python, and Cap'n Proto][cap]
  by Drew Fisher
* [SQLite: Gotchas and Gimmes][sql] by Dave Sawyer
* [Postgres present and future][post] by Craig Kerstiens
* [Pythons in A Container - Lessons Learned Dockerizing Python Micro-Services][dock]
  by Dorian Pula
* [Build a Better Hat Rack: All Contributions Welcome][hat] by Katie McLaughlin
* [Building Protocol Libraries The Right Way][prot] by Cory Benfield

Day 2:

* [What Is and What Can Be: An Exploration from \`type\` to Metaclasses][mcl] by Dustin Ingram
* [Python Typology][typ] by Matthias Kramm
* [Prototyping New APIs with Flask][fapi] by David Baumgold
* [Shipping Software To Users With Python][ship] by Glyph
* [Remote Calls != Local Calls: Graceful Degradation when Services Fail][rem] by Daniel Riti
* [Get Instrumented: How Prometheus Can Unify Your Metrics][prom] by Hynek Schlawack
* [Dispelling the 'Genius Programmer' myth through code review][gen] by Ashwini Oruganti

Day 3:

* [See Python, See Python Go, Go Python Go][go] by Andrey Petrov
* [Removing Python's GIL: The Gilectomy][gil] by Larry Hastings

... and there are probably as many talks that are still on my watch-later
queue (I just keep getting distracted by Overwatch videos, though).

Of all these perhaps my favourite talk was (as expected) by Larry Hastings about
his Gilectomy talk where he led the audience through his quest to remove the
GIL. Although, ≈Åukasz Langa's talk about coroutines is also very high up on my
list right now. I really have to find the time to play with asyncio et
al. eventually.

I also went to quite a few infrastructure, community, and best-practice talks as
those should be applicable no matter what programming language you're using.


## Sprints

After the talk-days came four (three for us) glorious sprinting days were Ulrich
and I mostly worked on PyVideo/PyTube related things. You can find more about
that in [a post I wrote last week][pytube].

This year even more people stayed for the sprints and so we got multiple large
session rooms full of people! For some reason another large hall on the other
end of the building was set up for lunch (instead of using on on the same side)
but at least I got my step-count up again üòâ One day we also went to a Taco Bell
nearby as neither Ulrich nor I had ever been to one. As far as US fast-food
goes, it was surprisingly good! No ill side-effects on the next day so we
didn't have to drop out of the sprints.

During these days we also quite often met up with other conference goes
afterwards at local breweries. Some, for some reasons, hadn't known about
[Basecamp Brewing][] just a few blocks from the venue. We definitely had to do
something about that!


## Everything else

As in previous years the organisation of PyCon 2016 was top-notch! Except for
lunch on the first day (with a queue going through the whole conference
building) everything went very smoothly as far as I can tell. What surprised me
a little bit was the lack of actually useful stuff in the goodie bags. The
sponsors obviously now want you to come to their respective booth for more
interaction. If this trend continues, the bag stuffing might end up being
pointless in the future. I really hope that we still have some time left on that
clock as it is one of my favourite events at PyCon.

Something else that didn't go as well as in last years were the announcements
regarding the event dinners. Up until a few days before the conference the hosts
of these events hadn't been announced and so Ulrich and I held off for too long
to get seats. Not a big thing as we had discovered enough awesome places to have
dinner but still...

That being said, I can't wait to return to Portland next year and thanks to
[Cameron Dershem][] I'm also looking cautiously forward to 2017 when PyCon will
be in Cleveland.
