# Looking back at PyGraz 2016.03

Last Tuesday we once again had our local Python meetup in Graz. It's also been
the second month in a row where we were hosted by [Realraum][]; big thanks for
that ðŸ˜ƒ While according to our format rotation we should have had a handful of
lightning talks the event ended up as mix of a lightning talk, a full talk, and
some addendums which worked really well! I think we even broke our
attendees-record this time with IIRC 16 people ðŸ˜ƒ

-------

Huge thanks also go to [Thomas][] for his talk about
[working with XPath in Python][xpath] and [Lukas][] for his
[introduction of various functional programming techniques][func] and helpers!
As a bit of an addendum to the latter I mentioned Graham Dumpleton excellent
[wrapt][] library which makes creating decorators on Python a breeze and also
David Mertz' mini-book on [Functional Programming in Python][], which I'm
reading right now.

Afterwards [Stefan][] was curious about our experience with various web
development frameworks so we had a lengthy discussion of where things like JSF
and Spring have their place compared to tools like Django or Flask.

If you want to join us, the next meetup will most likely be on 5 April. Since we
haven't had a restaurant-meetup for quite a while now and some topics to discuss
concerning the future of PyGraz April's event will probably take place at either
the GÃ¶sserbrÃ¤u or The Pub. Offical announcements will - as always - be made on
[meetup.com][] and [PyGraz.org][] ðŸ˜Š
