# eJournaling away!

On my flight to Brussels for FOSDEM I had the chance to give Lufthansa's new
eJournal service a try. That service had been
[announced](https://www.lufthansagroup.com/de/presse/meldungen/view/archive/2016/january/14/article/3886.html)
just two weeks earlier and aims to replace printed board-magazins and journals
with PDFs in order to save weight and produce less waste (and save some money,
obviously ðŸ˜‰).

About two days before the take-off I received an e-mail including a voucher-link
for a download portal where I could pick two items from, I'd say, 20-30
newspapers and again about 20 magazines. The options here were quite diverse
including national and international products in various languages. For
Austrians "Der Standard" and "Profil" were available among other newspapers,
various car magazines and even I think the US-edition of "Wired
Magazine". Sadly, I couldn't find either any videogaming publications nor "The
Guardian".

Technically, the portal is easy to use, albeit optically a bit boring, but while
I tried to download my PDFs it seemed rather slow. The PHP application that was
running in the background seemed to be loading the PDFs into memory before
serving them to the user. Apart from that and if you know what to do with PDFs
it's a nice service that I will definitely use again in the future instead of
picking up dead-tree editions of the same publications ðŸ˜Š

That being said, sadly, you don't receive another voucher on the return trip. At
least that was the case for me and my 4-day period between getting to Brussels
and returning home. Perhaps, for longer periods you will receive multiple
vouchers or you simply have to use one voucher for each direction ðŸ˜‰
