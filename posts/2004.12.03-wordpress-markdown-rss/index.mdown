# Wordpress, Markdown and RSS

Ok, the RSS, RSS2 and Atom feeds should now work again. Previously (to be precise right after I enabled then markdown plugin) they simply included unformated content which looked ugly at best and was lacking some semantic at worst ;-)

Thanks to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/10/5493">this topic</a> in the WordPress support forum I could fix this small problem and I will apply these fixes on gamerslog.com tomorrow (after getting some sleep).

To the posters involved in solving this problem: Thank you very much :-) You saved me from reading the RSS specification :-)
