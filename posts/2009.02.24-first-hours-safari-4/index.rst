Today Apple released the first the `first public beta of Safari 4
<http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html>`_. As a very curious person I,
naturally, had to already give it a try :-) Since I'm still using Webkit in
the background, I can't really say anything about the version of the rendering
engine; so I will focus on the GUI changes here. So far I really like it. Sure
there are a few smaller issues and tons of stuff that I have to get used to,
but overall Safari 4 looks like a good evolution.


-------------------------------

So let's take a look at some of the features I've been really enjoying so far:

Top Sites
---------

The first thing you will see in the new GUI is the so-called "Top Sites" page.
If you've used Opera recently (within the last 2 years) you will probably
already know something quite similar with `"Speed Dial"
<http://portal.opera.com/discover/?feature=speeddial>`_ from there. The
difference is, that Safari tries to give you the sites you've visited most
recently. If you like a site to stay on that view, you have to explicitly mark
it as sticky. Nice tough and thanks to it having its own shortcut
(cmd+shift+1) I can definitely see myself using it a lot in the future. Just
one thing, though: Please, Apple, add some keyboard navigation there.

Coverflow Integration
---------------------

For the last couple of releases of virtually any Apple product they have been
trying to push their `Coverflow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_Flow>`_
widget really hard. So it was inevitable that also their web-browser would
finally use it in one way or another. For me, that widget was always kind of a
graphical gimmick. Nice to have, but rarely to use. Not so in Safari 4. For the
first time I actually see a practical benefit for me. I'm kind of a visual
person. When I see a website I'm quite sure that I will recognize it again
when seeing a screenshot. Not so with titles.  So the Coverflow
integration into the history browser of Safari 4 makes really tons of sense for
me. Thank you, Apple. Your browser is the first where I can actually really
*use* the history :-)

The New Adressbar
-----------------

One of the really great new features of Firefox 3 is its addressbar which acts
also as kind of a search helper for previously visited pages simply by not
only matching the prefix of a URL but more or less arbitrary substrings in the
URL as well as in the title of a page. Sadly Safari 4's so-called "Smart
Address Field" doesn't go that far but limits its search on the URL part. But
at least it now gives you also the title last seen with the URL you're typing.

The new address field now also includes the Refresh/Stop button which was
previously available is its own button. I'm not so sure if this doesn't really
push the whole "compact layout" idea a bit too far, though.


So far I really like Safari 4. Some features not mentioned here I'm still
trying to get used to. Esp. the new position of the tabs is a nice feature for
people like me who are often working on their MacBooks on the go and need
every pixel of screen-estate they can get, but it's still quite a change (yet
I really want to see that integrated into Terminal.app). 

But if this degree of evolution is what we can expect from Snow Leopard, I
can't wait :-)
