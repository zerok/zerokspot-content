# Ruby's website redesigned

Finally Ruby has now also a [nice website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). The whole site is now in my opinion much more usable with offering links in prominent positions to guides on how to find an use 3rd-party libraries, the documentation and so on. 

The site now also uses Ruby on Rails in the backend with a [CMS](http://radiantcms.org/) that has been written in the process of creating that site and that has also been open source'd. Great work :D

For more details, check out the [announcement on ruby-lang.org](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2006/09/12/site-launch-at-last/).
