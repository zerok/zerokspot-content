# Apple's Boot Camp

Well, not we at least know, why there was no announcement on their 30th birthday ;) Given that this was on the 1st April no one would have believed it, but now it's a different story. It seems like Apple has released with [Boot Camp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/) the beta version of an official installation path for Windows XP on the new Intel-based Macs.

Strange idea, but it could really help making Macs more attractive for people who would normally never buy one since they wouuldn't be able to switch back to Windows if they didn't like MacOSX. *thumbs_up*, although I would never want to run Windows on my Mac ;)
