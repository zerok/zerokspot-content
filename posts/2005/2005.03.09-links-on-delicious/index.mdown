# Links on del.icio.us

I've now finally changed the links-URL to point to <a href="http://del.icio.us/zeroK/">my del.icio.us repository</a>. For me it simply doesn't make sense to post the same links on at least 2 different pages so this was quite a logical step since I'm adding links there nearly daily ;-)
