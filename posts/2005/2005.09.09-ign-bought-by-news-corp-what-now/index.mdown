# IGN bought by News Corp: What now?

Ok, so now it's official: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has bought the large gaming site network IGN (which just resently fused with GameSpy). While some might see this as tragedy I hope that IGN can benefit from this new financially really big owner because honestly I had and still have some problems with IGN as it is today. I don't mean the quality of the articles or something but more the whole presentation. About 2 years ago I was a paying member over there since I expected some real benefits. But if you are bombed with ads and ads and ads to no end it really doesn't motivate you to pay for it.

On the other hand I'm not really a fan of large media companies since I see things like this as simply another method of censorship and onesided information publishing. But I'd say: Let's see how it works out :) In the end a product is only as popular as the customers want it to be :)
