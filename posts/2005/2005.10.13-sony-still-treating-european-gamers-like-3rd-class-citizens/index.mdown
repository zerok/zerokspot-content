# Sony still treating European gamers like 3rd class citizens

According to <a href="http://ps2.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=9507">this article</a> on boomtown European gamers will have to wait until 2006 for version 2.5 of the PSP firmware. Not that it's all that critical for me to get this update but it's IMO still quite annoying. First we had to wait for many months to get the European version of the PSP and now also the software updates are delayed. I think it would at least be nice to get a plausible reason for the delays :(
