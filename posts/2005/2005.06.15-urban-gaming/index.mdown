# Urban gaming

Thanks to <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/">Eric Meyer</a> I found this <a href="http://newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7498">nice article about urban gaming</a>. Before this article I always thought that it would be fun to run around playing real-world-pacman but I never thought that there were already games like this going on out there :-) Esp. playing RPGs could be damn cool. I just home that no one gets the idea of playing Quake3 in real live and thinking it's just a game :-? But pacman in Klagenfurt? Where can I get a pacman costume? :-)
