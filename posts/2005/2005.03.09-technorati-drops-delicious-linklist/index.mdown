# Technorati drops del.icio.us linklist...

Technorati seems to have drop related links from posted on del.icio.us from the search result pages that you get when searching for specific tags. Now only FUrl is listed anymore. Since Technorati doesn't seem to have some news section or at least made no real official announcement about the changes (perhaps) related to the new <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/03/06/new_technorati_tag_feature.php">related tags</a> feature, all I could find about this is what <a href="http://lists.burri.to/pipermail/delicious-discuss/2005-March/002254.html">Joshua Schachter posted on the del.icio.us mailinglist</a>.

IMO it would be really great if Technorati had some news page or changelog where users could keep track of new features, changes etc. :-)
