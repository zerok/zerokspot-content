# AOL owning my ICQ messages?

First of all: Merry Christmas everyone :)

-------------------------------



Now to the main topic of this post ;) A few hours ago (right before the "Christkind" visited my house) I read <a href="http://www.netzpolitik.org/2005/weihnachtslekture-icq-policy-nimmt-copyright-an-chats/">this article on netzpolitik.org</a> where the author quoted a section of the ICQ User Policy where every user has to surrender his/her copyright on any posted information or material ... Reminds me somehow of the policy on Amazon websites regarding posting of product reviews. Anyway: Just another reason for me to stop using ICQ. What I write (no matter where) belongs to me and me alone, and not to Mirabilis , AOL, whoever.
