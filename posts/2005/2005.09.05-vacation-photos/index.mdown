# Vacation photos

As already mentioned in the previous post I've just recently returned from a 16-days trip to Denmark and Germany. A time which I also used to make tons of photos which I'm not in the process of uploading to Flickr. Since weekends are short and weekdays busy I have not even managed to upload at least the first half of the photos. On this occassion I want to apologize to the flickr servers and staff for uploading around 400 photos in 3 days ;)

First I wanted to write a small roundup about the whole trip here (which will probably still come) but now I plan to write some text to most of the photos and only write a small summary here. Every photo comes with a specific feeling and memory for me so it's probably better handled this way :)
