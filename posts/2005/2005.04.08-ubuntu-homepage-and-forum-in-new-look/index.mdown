# Ubuntu homepage and forum in new look

<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/gallery/image.php?id=56&action=viewthumb" class="left" alt=""/>The new look of the Ubuntu pages I now finally public :-) The main sections are now accessible to some tabs similiar to the mozilla.org design which now makes it far better accessible IMO. Really nice :-) Now let's wait for the release of Ubuntu Linux 5.04 ;-)
