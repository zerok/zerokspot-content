# First season of Charmed for 35USD???

Yesterday I found on a website a note that the first season of Charmed is now available in the USA and that there are also release dates for the UK and the Netherlands. I couldn't really find a date for the German (and Austrian ;-) ) market yet, but that's not really a problem for me.

What is a problem for me is first the date of the UK release (April 25th IIRC) and the price. On amazon.co.uk the DVD package costs <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/convert?amt=29.99&from=GBP&to=EUR&submit=Convert">29.99pounds</a>. On amazon.com the whole package costs only <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/convert?amt=34.99&from=USD&to=EUR&submit=Convert">34.99USD</a>(!!!), so I'd save nearly 20â¬ if I order the first season in the USA...
