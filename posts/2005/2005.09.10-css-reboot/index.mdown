# CSS Reboot

I've just registered zerokspot.com on <a href="http://cssreboot.com">cssreboot.com</a> which means that I plan to relaunch this site here on the 1st November with a complete new look and probably also with some new structure. I'm not completely sure yet how much I will change on the structure but I've definitely some ideas to evaluate ;)

-------------------------------



And finally even the last photo from my trip is available on flickr.com. Each photo has the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/zerok/tags/denmarkgermany2005/">denmarkgermany2005</a> tag assigned so if you want to watch only these photos, go ahead :)
