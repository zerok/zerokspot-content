# Yahoo buying blo.gs

Seems like <a href="http://trainedmonkey.com/entry/2251">Yahoo has bought the ping service blo.gs</a>. It really looks like the big companies out there are finally interested in the good community services out there. First Blogger, then Bloglines, then Yahoo! ... We could start playing a game guessing who is next to be aquired and by whome ;-) The problem is... I don't  really know and big community services anymore...

Anyway, Jim Winstead stated that nothing should change from the user perspective so Yahoo! should be a good home for blo.gs ;-)
