# Marko DugonjiÄ about MSIE CSS hacks

Marko DugonjiÄ has posted a really nice listing of some <a href="http://www.maratz.com/blog/archives/2005/06/16/essentials-of-css-hacking-for-internet-explorer/">IE CSS hacks on his weblog</a> :-) There he describes things like conditional comments, parser hacks to solve the box model problem in IE 5.x and other useful stuff :-) Esp. the display:inline trick could become quite interesting for me in the future ;-)
