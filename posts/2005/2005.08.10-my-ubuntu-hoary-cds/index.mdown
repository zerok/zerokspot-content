# My Ubuntu Hoary CDs :)

Today I finally got my <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a> Hoary CDs :) Now let's see how long it will take to get at least a few of these to some new (or old) Linux users :) It took quite some time though and I nearly lost all hope since I ordered them right when Hoary was released. But there is really nothing to complain about considering that this whole service is free :)
