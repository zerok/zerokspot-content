# zs now with FeedBurner

I've now replaced the RSS and Atom feeds here with the feeds provided by FeedBurner... just for testing :-) The URLs haven't and won't change. I just want to give it a try and see if it's useful enough for me :-) I'm esp. curious how many people are actually reading these feeds ;-)
