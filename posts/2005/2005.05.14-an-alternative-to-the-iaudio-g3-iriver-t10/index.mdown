# An alternative to the iAudio G3: iriver T10

Seems like iriver finally managed to produce a real competetor to my iAudio G3: The iriver T10. It offers 53 hours of playback with OGG support (even Q10 :D ) and from what I can guess from the <a href="http://www.iriver.co.kr/common/notice/view.asp?Page=1&SrchItem=&SrchString=&idx=808">koreon product page</a> (guessing is the right word since I don't know a single korean word :P ) it only needs (at least) one AA battery. You also get an FM radio. It also looks quite nice and robust. If I hadn't a comparable player yet, I'd probably stongly consider getting this one :-)
