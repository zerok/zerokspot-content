# Firefox 1.5 release imminent?

Well, I naturally mean this in the most positive way possible :) Seems like there are already quite a few packages on the <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/">official release servers</a> and also the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/1.5.html">release notes </a> can already be accessed. It really seems like the big day will be today :)
