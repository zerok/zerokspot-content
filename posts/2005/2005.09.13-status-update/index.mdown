# Status update

Well, it's been quiet here for a few days mainly because I'm working quiet hard on my CSSReboot contribution ;) I also started to play Final Fantasy VII again. Ok, it's really old and the graphics hurt the modern eye but I bought it a few years ago and never came around playing it as intense as it's worth. And after midnight there is always some time left for Wipeout Pure ;)

Hopefully I will soon find something useful to write about, but for now a status update is the best I can give you ;)
