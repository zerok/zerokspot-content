# WP Tiger Administration

After having read about the alternative admin interface <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration">Tiger</a> by Steven Smith on orderedlist.com I now dared the step and installed it ;-) Steven Smith has created a really nice admin interface which is very easy to use and also simply looks great :-) Very simplistic, no images... simply great :-) If you have a WordPress weblog I'd recommend that you at least give it a try. It's quite easy to install. Actually it's like a plugin: Extract the zip, put the wp-admin-tiger folder into the plugins folder and activate it in the plugins-page of the admin panel. Voilß .
