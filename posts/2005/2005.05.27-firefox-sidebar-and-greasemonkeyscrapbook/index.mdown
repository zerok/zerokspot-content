# Firefox sidebar and Greasemonkey+Scrapbook

<a class="left" href="http://www.edu.uni-klu.ac.at/~hgutmann/gallery/image.php?id=62&action=viewfull"><img src="http://www.edu.uni-klu.ac.at/~hgutmann/gallery/image.php?id=62&action=viewthumb" alt="FF without sidebar"/></a>Yesterday I finally decided to install Greasemonkey to try <a href="http://www.pixelgraphix.de/log/2005-05/styling-delicious.php">Manuela Hoffmanns's del.icio.us style</a> and everything went fine ... but then I had to restart Firefox and suddenly the bookmark sidebar was gone. There was nothing left but a blank widget and the title of the sidebar. Why do I mention Scrapbook in the title? After removing Greasemonkey and Scrapbook (which was updates yesterday) the bookmark sidebar worked again. Then I installed both extensions once again and everything worked... and today the sidebar is gone.

-------------------------------



Now I've removed Greasemonkey and Scrapbook in one step and had to restart Firefox 2 times to get the sidebar back. After installing Greasemonkey the sidebar is still there, so it seems like Scrapbook is somehow responsible :-? or not.... installing Scrapbook __after__ installing Greasemonkey seemed to have no effect on the sidebar. At least it is back again. I don't really care all that much about the how and why :-)
