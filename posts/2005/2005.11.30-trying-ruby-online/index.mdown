# Trying Ruby online

Being simply too lazy to install the interpreter and opening an editor is no excuse anymore. On <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">http://tryruby.hobix.com/</a> you can now try Ruby in an interactive online tutorial that guides you through some of features of this language starting with some basic string manipulation (like reversing a string), over list generation and manipulation (sorting).
