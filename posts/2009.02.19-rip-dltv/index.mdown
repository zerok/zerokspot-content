# R.I.P. DL.tv 

<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/snapshots/dltvrip-20090219-130756.png" alt="" class="left postimg" />A bit of internet history has left the scene last week: [DL.tv](http://dl.tv/2009/02/long_live_dltv_1.php). After [267](http://dl.tv/2005/08/episode_1_available_now_1.php) episodes the show has probably received that bit too much restructuring. I think I started watching it back in late 2005 and even went back once to show the very first couple of episodes just to get them all. Back then [DL.tv](http://dl.tv/) provided something quite unique for me: A video tech-show available online and free of charge ... and in a good resolution ;-) It always had its own style which I really enjoyed, never being completely serious while not appearing arrogant or dismissive on new and crazy stuff. 

A big "Thank you" to the crew that made this great show possible and good luck for the future. Now I really hope that this will result in Robert being more often a guest on TekZilla ;-)
