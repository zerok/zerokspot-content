# Started learning OCAML

Today I started learning OCaml, an object-oriented functional language. I won't write all that much about my learning progress here since 43things is IMO the better place to do this. But on the other hand I will probably write a small summary after I've reached a point where I think that I know the basics :-) 

-------------------------------



If you want to see my progress simply read my progress reports on <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/zeroK/485352">43things.com</a> :-) There I will also post links to the articles I read about OCaml in addition to adding them to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/zeroK/ocaml">del.icio.us OCaml repository</a> :-)
