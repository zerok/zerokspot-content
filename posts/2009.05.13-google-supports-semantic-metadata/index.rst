Google announced more support for semantic metadata
###################################################

After companies like Yahoo_ and Technorati_ have no experimented for quite
some time with support for Microformats_, Google_ announced their own support
for some Microformat and RDFa_ vocabularies. According to `James Turner`_ of
the O'Reilly Radar this only works for a handful of partner-sites right now
but, I guess, this should only be a matter of time. For now the supported
metadata is about *product reviews*, *product prices* and *personal details*.
Google's made some more details available in their documentation_.

What's in my opinion really nice about this is, that Google supports not just
one encoding but Microformats *and* RDFa. If you ask 3 people how to handle
metadata on the web, you'll probably get 3 different answers ;-)
