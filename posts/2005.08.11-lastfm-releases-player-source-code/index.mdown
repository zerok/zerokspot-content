# Last.fm releases player source code

Today <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> has released a source package of their player so that finally Linux and Mac user can also listen to the radio stations again. The thing has just one problem: It requires Qt4 which is AFAIK not yet bundled with any major distribution so you'll have to compile Qt4 yourself if you want to have this player. Let's see how long it will take me :)
