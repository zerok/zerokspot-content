# QotD: They're Grrreat!

<img class="left" src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/mascots_wintercoke.jpg" alt="Coca Cola's icebear"/>As you might have noticed by now: I like the idea of having a question of the day. But since the questions posted on [Vox](http://questions.vox.com/) are normally not really tech-related, it is quite hard for me to use them without getting on your blacklist. So I will try to just pick those, that I can answer in a techy way :)

What or who is your favorite product mascot? Why?

Well, this is a quite hard one since nowadays mascots seem not to be that "in" anymore. Anyway, here a short list of mascots I can at least remember:

* [Konqui](http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-announce&m=92490116402523&w=2), the mascot first of the KDE browser "Konqueror"
* [Hexley](http://www.hexley.com/), the Darwin mascot
* [Tux](http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/), the Linux pinguin
* [BSD Daemon](http://www.freebsd.org/art.html)
* [Larry the Cow](http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/about.xml), Gentoo Linux

On the non-tech side I remember following:

* The ice-bear in the Coca Cola commercials in winter
* The [WWF Panda](http://www.wwf.org/)

I guess it's a hard race between Hxley, Tux, Coca Cola's bear and the panda... apropos panda: I love the [PVPOnline panda](http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20030413) ;)
