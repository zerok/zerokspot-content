# What about Del.icio.us?

Given the recent news of [Joshua Schachter leaving Yahoo](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/19/it-gets-worse-for-yahoo-delicious-founder-leaving/) what future does [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) really have? The last real life-sign (besides some plugins or module or various browsers) was in September last year when they showed a [preview](http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2007/09/taste-test.html) of the next generation engine built around [Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) and honestly: There wasn't anything to blow you away in this preview; no really new features, just a re-design.

-------------------------------

But how much interest does Yahoo! really have in this product? They didn't even bother to integrate their login system as they did with Flickr within just a few months. And in general not all that much was added feature-wise to the site after the acquisition. [Private bookmarks](http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2006/03/private_saving_.html) were added in March 2006 and [Networks](http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2006/04/its_made_out_of.html), which basically is nothing more than a low-level friends-feature, a month later. After that there came only minor improvements and since late 2007 there is mostly radio silence. I guess that's it for del.icio.us then :-(
