# What a day ...

There are some days, you simply want to erase from your memory. First thing I did when I came to work this morning, I bought myself the MacHeist2 bundle for stuff like [CSSEdit 2](http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/) and [Pixelmator](http://pixelmator.com/) and was absolutely surprised how I could survive until now without [CoverSutra](http://coversutra.com/). But just a few minutes later, I got something in my inbox that I hadn't expected: A mail from [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) telling me that I owe them nearly 400 USD and my CC has already been charged with it ... WTF! I won't even go into the details here, because they are [officially documented](http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2008/01/15/billing-issues/) well enough.

-------------------------------

I also want to start forgetting that part of the day ... Dreamhost also already helped on this front with a mail telling me that the money was already on its way back to my CC. Let's see ... 

I guess for the rest of the day I will simply try to get over the shock (possible of my whole life so far) and have some fun with all these great shareware apps and some [Red vs. Blue](http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/ "Red vs. Blue &middot; News").
