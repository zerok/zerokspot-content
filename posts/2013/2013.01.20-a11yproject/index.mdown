# The Accessibility Project

Being in the web development scene for a decade now, naturally, had me dealing again and again with accessibility. Sadly, when looking around for *best-practices* and other *up-to-date resources* for making the sites I'm working on as usable for as many people in as many situations as possible, there hasn't been a single great site for this. Sure, there are tons of articles and sites out there but many of them are either completely out of date or hide the useful bits in tons of statistics and other non-practical information so that you might not even get to them on your first try. The whole structure of specifications like the [WCAG 2.0][wcag2] doesn't help either.

-------------------

Imagine my delight when I stumbled upon [The Accessibility Project][tap], a new resource for every designer and developer who wants to learn about web accessibility. So far *The Accessibility Project* looks to get around the "hidden content" issue with simple and to-the-point tips like how to do a [simple check if your site can be navigated with just the keyboard][keyb] or what the [most important ARIA landmark roles][roles] are. For those who want more there is also an [extensive link list](http://a11yproject.com/resources.html) to off-site resources dealing with accessibility.

And regarding keeping this up-to-date: The project is managed on [Github][proj] so there is out of the box an [issue tracker][issues] and everyone is invited to contribute. There is even a very detailed [guide on how to get started][contrib]! And since the project has [just been started][ann] a couple of days ago, there is still lots of work to do. Some everyone who has something to contribute, **please do**!
