# Pulling up stakes

[Pulling up stakes][pus] is a new book series by [Peter David][pad], one of my favorite *Star Trek* authors, about a young vampire hunter who, unlike some other people in this line of work, actually doesn't really want to hunt vampires. This could be explained by his young age, his rebellious type ... or simply because he is a vampire himself but no one must know this.

--------

Compared to some other books I've read recently or am reading in parallel "Pulling up stakes" is pure lighthearted entertainment. No complex jumping around between time-periods or something like that; just something I could read to relax. The whole story is presented in the usual "Peter David"-style (at least judging by his books of the "New Frontier" series) with a lot of sarcasm, humor and tons of action. The main character is very self-aware, meaning that he knows he often does stupid things, yet also quite witty.

My favorite part of the book was how vampires and the myths surrounding them were depicted here. I won't spoil anything but unlike franchises like *Blade* and *Underworld* the protagonist enjoys telling you everything about these creatures of the night in a lot of detail and nearly in some kind of "Macgyver"-way. Think of Vincent as the [Michael Westen][mw] of vampirism.

So, if you're looking for a "popcorn-book" for relaxing after a long day of work, this is just great! I can't wait for the next book of the series to be released ... which will, sadly, probably take a while since Peter David [suffered a stroke][str] right at the end of last year. [If you want to help][hlp], get his books that are listed on [crazy8press][c8p] (down at the moment but should, hopefully, be back up soon). As far as I know they are all available as ePubs and (through Amazon) for the Kindle. "Pulling up stakes" is also fairly cheap at less than USD 4. For some reason the book was split into two parts ([one][pus] for below $1, [the other][pus2] for below $3) but they definitely cover only one story.

Big thanks to [David Mack][src] for spreading the word.
