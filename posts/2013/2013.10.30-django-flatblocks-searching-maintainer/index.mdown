# Django-flatblocks needs a new maintainer

It has been quite a while since [Django-Flatblocks][df] has seen any kind of meaningful activity (except for the Python 3/Django 1.6 patch by [Alexander Ovchinnikov][ao] today) mostly because I personally haven't used it for a similarly long time now. It seems like a few people out there are still using it so I don't want to let it die if I don't have to. Because of this I'm now looking for someone to take over as maintainer.

If you're interested, please contact me (details on the about page). My main requirement is that you actually use it and therefor have a vested interest in keeping the code stable and in good shape :-)
