# TechnoratiTags on zerokspot.com

I've now also installed the <a href="http://www.gudlyf.com/archives/2005/01/14/wordpress-plugin-technotag/">TechnoTags plugin for WordPress</a> here, to be precise <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/attachment/wiki/TechnoTag/technotag.php">the version by William Spaetzel</a> and added some small modifications myself. IMO the whole concept of this whole tagging is really nice and simple as long as no one abuses the whole category system :-(
