# New items in Bloglines broken?

Is it just me or is bloglines more or less broken currently? In the overview listing in the left frame there are tons of updates weblogs but most of the times when I actually want to see these new items, there are none. I already tried playing around with the "Display items within last ... " option but without any success :( 

-------------------------------



This way staying up-to-date is really not easy esp. considering that Bloglines should actually help there. Perhaps this means back to a different reader but for the time being I will probably simply add the most important feeds to my live bookmarks but this isn't really anything else but a temporary solution for me :-(
