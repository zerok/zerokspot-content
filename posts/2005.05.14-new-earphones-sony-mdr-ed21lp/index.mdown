# New earphones: Sony MDR-ED21LP

<a class="left" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/13743876/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos10.flickr.com/13743876_71eba388dc_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="The new duo with bass in my pocket" /></a>So I've find some new earphones: The Sony MDR-ED21LP. They are more or less exactly like my previous earphones which I came to love in the years we shared ;-) The main feature of these new earphones is the "Bass Booster" feature which besides emphazising the bass effect it helps holding the earphones in the ear which is really nice esp. if you're driving a lot with the bike :-) To be honest I would have prefered the MDR-EX* earbuds ... but I'm not really willing to pay 50EUR and more for earphones.
