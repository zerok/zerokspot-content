<html><body><h1>New "Light" theme for Ubuntu</h1><p>
	Seems like Ubuntu is finally about to dump the primarily brown theme it has been using for the last ... well, since its first release. On the equally new <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Brand?action=recall&amp;rev=4">brand page</a>&nbsp;you can find a screenshot for each variant of the theme (dark and bright) as well as the new logo. Personally, I think the new look is really nice, judging from the screenshots I saw (Putting it on my netbook would kind of defeat the purpose of that devices ;-)). It appears to me far more mature and slightly more &quot;professional&quot; than the previous &quot;Human&quot; theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What I don&#39;t like, or at least haven&#39;t come around liking, is the new window-button order (the buttons you see in the upper left corner of each window in these screenshots): For me, the action I use the most on any given window is the &quot;close&quot; action. And this is just easiest to reach when positioned in one of the outer corners. Perhaps has a patent on having the close button in the top right corner and it being red ... who knows.</p>
<p>
	If you want to know more without installing it, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/03/hands-on-a-close-look-at-ubuntus-new-non-brown-theme.ars">Ars Technica</a> has some nice hands-on article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Now I just have to find some not-used notebook with an Intel chip that I could put this onto :-/</p>
