# This was 2009

2009 was quite an eventful year for me so, I guess, it is worth taking a look back. Finally got my diploma degree, found a new job, a new apartment, at least some travelling ... Sadly, I haven&#39;t written about most of that stuff here on my blog but thanks to <a href="https://www.tweetscan.com/data.php">TweetScan</a> I could also play a little data-mining on my tweets.

-------------

## January

The year started with a shocker: The 1UP I grew to love over the last couple of years thanks to great podcasts like 1UP Yours experienced quite an <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/01/08/farewell-1upcom-crew/">exodus</a> with most of the crew getting laid off. In other gaming news I played a bit of <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/01/26/prince-of-persia/">Prince of Persia</a> for PS3 ;-)

Technology-wise I started playing around with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> which I also ended up using as backend for our TwitterWall at February&#39;s Barcamp Klagenfurt.

## February

In February Klagenfurt once again had its own <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/02/08/das-war-das-barcamp-klagenfurt-2009/">Barcamp</a>, work started on a sexy <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/02/17/sexy-new-mercurial-site-project/">new site for Mercurial</a>&nbsp;and Apple released the first <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/02/25/first-hours-safari-4/">public beta for Safari 4</a>. Not bad for only 28 days.

## March

For me perhaps the biggest change in March was that - all of a sudden - I had to <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/03/24/lastfm-charge-streaming/">pay for last.fm</a> while users from the USA, UK or Germany could still enjoy the whole service for free.

## April

I finally finished my master thesis and received my diploma degree in computer science from the <a href="http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/">University of Klagenfurt</a>. It&#39;s been really nice there but now it is finally time to do something else :-) A big &quot;Thank you&quot; to everyone who helped me during that period.

## May

Finally a <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/05/10/eurodjangocon2009/">Django conference on European soil</a> and even somewhere where beer is cheaper than mineral water ;-) Since this was the only conference I attended in 2009 it might sound stupid to say it was the best of 2009 ... but it was and really great at that. In Prague I also watched the <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/05/11/startrek-the-new-movie/">latest Star Trek movie</a>, which for me personally is probably the best ever. Even better than <em>First Contact</em>.

## June

June was my very own summer (and in the end really black) hole. No relevant tech news, not all that much new to play (apart form <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/06/08/infamous-review/">inFamous</a> which I finished during the first week) ...

## July

I started at my new job at <a href="http://netconomy.net/">Netconomy</a> in Graz ... and that basically sums up that month. Tons of work, little time for anything else especially since the apartment was still to furnish (and still partially is) :-) Just one thing: YouTube <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/youtube-will-be-next-to-kiss-ie6-support-goodbye/">announced</a> that they would stop supporting IE6 (aka scourge of modern web development).

## August

Can&#39;t remember anything specific about this month but <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/archives/date-posted/2009/08/">Flickr came to the rescue</a> and told me that there was a night photowalk in Klagenfurt :-) Ah, and <a href="http://blog.friendfeed.com/2009/08/friendfeed-accepts-facebook-friend.html">FriendFeed was acquired by Facebook</a> and I immediately stopped using it. To this date I actually don&#39;t really know why. I guess it was just coincidence that I suffered from Web 2.0 fatigue right at the same time; although, it is not like anything happened afterwards on FriendFeed :-( At the same time the <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/04/ie6-no-more/">IE6 No More campaign</a> was launched and it was quite a blast to see so many popular websites participating.

Apple also released Snow Leopard to the masses and with 30EUR at a really nice price-point. Naturally, I had to <a href="http://twitter.com/zerok/statuses/3603212203">get it on day-one</a> ;-)

## September

After living with half-broken headphones for about a year by now (I mostly killed them in October 2008 on my way to the Barcamp in Munich at that time) I <a href="http://twitter.com/zerok/statuses/4155101433">finally got the best headphones</a> I&#39;ve had so far: A pair of AKG K450. Expensive but worth every cent :-) I also discovered&nbsp;<a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/09/27/mongodb-and-stuff/">MongoDB</a>&nbsp;as an alternative to CouchDB which I used immediately on this site.

## October

Not all that much happened in October ... except for a really wonderful <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/10/04/photwalkwien2009/">photowalk in Vienna</a> with tons of great people and perfect weather for exploring the Museumsquartier. Another part of Podcast history died, too: The <a href="http://kotaku.com/5378439/in-an-end-of-an-era-listen-up-podcast-bids-its-host-farewell">final episode of Listen UP</a> (formerly 1UP Yours) was aired ... on the web ... whatever you call that.

## November

One year older, hurray ... That and we went climbing ;-)

## December

Amazon finally managed to bring their <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/12/05/finally-some-choice/">MP3 store to Austria</a>; something I&#39;ve been waiting for ages. Personally, I mostly switched to WebKit based browsers at home, simply because Firefox is still too slow on OSX. The last days of the year I spent in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/sets/72157622981946915/">London</a>, together with my new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Nikon/nikon_d90.asp">Nikon D90</a> ... and enjoyed every minute of it, despite two out of 3 days being rainy and foggy. Btw.: Those Google Chrome ads in London really work - but only thanks to it also now finally being <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-holidays-mac-linux.html">available for OSX</a>.

## Goals for 2010

<ul>
	<li>
		More London. I really enjoyed my little trip there and I&#39;m still sad, that I couldn&#39;t stay longer.</li>
	<li>
		More traveling in general.</li>
	<li>
		Working a lot with <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. It looks like just the right mix of Java and functional programming for me to really enjoy it</li>
	<li>
		More Python and Django again.</li>
	<li>
		... and getting a life might also be nice for a change ;-)</li>
</ul>
