# ByeBye, Dreamhost

For the last 2 years I've now been a [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com)-customer. I initially moved there simply because of the price. It's really hard to beat 9USD per month for tons of disk space and bandwidth, not to mention [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/) support in addition to the usual LAMP-stuff. But then the first problems started when I noticed that it was kind of a rocky road to a mid-size configuration marathon to get for instance Django running there probably due to a really weird server config.

-------------------------------

Then after a series of smaller outages (that never really affected me that much) February 2007 came with a really [big one](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2007/02/28/super-lame-apology/) which ended up pissing off probably most of their customers including me. Then for the rest of the year the server was rather reliable, naturally still with the typical FastCGI-quirks that I really couldn't reproduce until the end. And actually these were the problems that drove me to look for a different host where I can reliably deploy whatever I want, be it Django, Pylons [insert WSGI app here], Rails, Drupal, ... whatever. Back then I was still thinking about still keeping my account there since it was cheap and there was nothing to say against a backup server ;-)

But then [January 15th 2008](http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2008/01/15/billing-issues/) came with Dreamhost accidentally billing (what it seems like) *all* their customers for the next 2 years. That was the moment when I decided to move *everything* off my Dreamhost account. It took me more or less an extra month to first of all get my own sites off but also a friend of mine who shares the account with me to move his sites off. 

So thank you Dreamhost for a mostly good experience but also with the tiny problems that sum up to annoyances. Not to mention the big problems like the whole billing issue which simply was too much.
