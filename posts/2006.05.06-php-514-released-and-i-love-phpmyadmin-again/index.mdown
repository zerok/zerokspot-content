# PHP 5.1.4 released and I love phpMyAdmin again

... and the end of main struggles with phpMyAdmin ;) For the last couple of days I was fighting with phpMyAdmin not to replace random column fields with Array data when submitting changes to a row. I was actually as far as going to the commandline client of mysql for inserting and updating data. But this morning I finally remembered, that the folks at [php.net](http://www.php.net) have [released PHP 5.1.4](http://www.php.net/release_5_1_4.php) yesterday, which has for example a fix for PHP 5.1.3 bug with handling $_POST in it ;)

Finally phpMyAdmin works again :D
