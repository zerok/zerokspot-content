# IEBlog

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IEBlog</a>: The Internet Explorer  team has now started its own blog (perhaps to get in closer contact with the user-base). Nice idea, but perhaps they should have put this thing only in valid HTML :-? I've just more or less skipped through this page but I'm quite happy to see that there are not really that many fanboys there or at least not that many of the kind who isn't able to explain the "why" :-) Here I also think it's a good sign, that the "pro-FireFox" posts are not deleted simply because of saying that a non-Microsoft-product is better.

Concluding I have to say that this blog looks really promising (although there are not really that interesting posts up there yet).
