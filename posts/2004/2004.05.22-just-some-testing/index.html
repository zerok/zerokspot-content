<html><body><h1>Just some testing :-)</h1><p><img src="http://weblog.zerokspot.com/wp-content/wp-button-6.gif" alt="WordPress button" class="left" />OK, this is my first post to this blog and I really hope it won't be the last ;-) Basically, this whole WordPress is just a testing ground for now. Perhaps it will become my real blog, perhaps not.</p><hr />
<p>In the last few hours I have played around with WordPress. Don't ask me why. I was just motivated to try something new... at least for me ;-)</p>



<p>What I've seen so far has quite impressed me. OK, a weblog isn't a full CMS IMO but after playing around with Typo3 a few months back I don't really care. What I've wanted was a simple way to publish my thoughts on some things, no matter if anybody is interested on or. It's just to let off some steam ;-) For everything longer I'll use DocBook or some other probably XML based publishing method.</p>



<p>For now, this blog will be available under <a href="http://www.zerokspot.com/blog/">http://www.zerokspot.com/blog/</a> and <a href="http://blog.zerokspot.com">http://blog.zerokspot.com</a> . As I've already mentioned above: In the end this could become my main log. For now it is perhaps just a little more than a playground for me.</p>



<p>I'll also port all the entries from board's weblog to this one, so that you can also use the calendar-navigation for the old entries.</p>
