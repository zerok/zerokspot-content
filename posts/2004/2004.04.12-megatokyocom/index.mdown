Thanks to a post on phpBB.com I found that great online comic this morning. After popping out of PvPonline for a month (or so) now I was once again interested in some webcomics so I gave this one a try. And my impression after 12 hours? I love it :-)

I'm currently somewhere around April 2001 in the archive over there and it's really funny and I just love that manga style :-) Basically it's about 2 nerds (or one otaku and one nerd *g* ) who somehow strand in Tokyo and .... ok, no spoiler here, but let me say at least this: They are really nerds :P

Enjoy :-) <br /><a href="http://www.megatokyo.com">http://www.megatokyo.com</a>
