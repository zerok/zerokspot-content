# Computer problems

<p>Nice summer, nice and hot .... actually too hot for some of my PC components. I don't know what exactly died an hours ago, but suddenly the whole display looked sun-dried. The colours where all wrong and so on. Monitor or graphical card, perhaps both... and with a really good timing. My GSM-service-provider just announced a new bonus server where it's now much easier to get a new mobile phone and well, I wanted one. Now I first have to find out what exactly died and replace it. So no money left for a new phone :-( Nice summer.</p>
