<html><body><h1>Some changes :-)</h1><p>As you've perhaps already noticed there are some new things on zerokspot.com. For example the slightly altered design (with the blue gradient in the main menu) and some small things like a games-collection listing or a listing of university courses I attend/attended. There I will probably also release some homeworks and things like that if someone needs them :-)</p<hr /><p>I finally also had some time to intergrate the articles into the main page's design.</p>





<h4>About the gallery</h4>

<p>I currently have little motivation to also change the design in there too. Perhaps this will happen within the next month or so.</p>
