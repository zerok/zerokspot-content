<html><body><h1>The banner</h1><p>As you might have noticed, zerokspot.com now has a slightly altered default banner. Until today I've used an image I've found through google. I've contacted the creator (or at least who I believe to be the creator) of the iceberg-photo that formed the background in the banner, but never got any reaction. So now I decided to drop it and use only photos that I've created or that I am explicitly allowed to use.</p><hr />
<p>For now I'll use a photo of my desktop and will search for another iceberg photo ;-)</p>
