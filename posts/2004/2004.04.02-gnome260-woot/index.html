<html><body><h1>Gnome 2.6.0 w00t</h1><h4>Yesterday 23:35 GMT+1</h4>
<p>The source packages appear on <a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org">ftp.gnome.org</a> and ... yeah, lftp is really a nice tool ;-)</p>

<h4>Today 06:30 GMT+1</h4>
<p>Right after getting up I notice that there is now an ebuild (rc5) for Gnome 2.6 available in the Gentoo Portage, extremely masked but anyway. </p>

<h4>Today 07:45 GMT+1</h4>
<p>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~x86 emerge -U /usr/portage/gnome-base/gnome/gnome-2.6.0_rc5.ebuild
on my laptop</p>

<h4>Today 15:00 GMT+1</h4>
<p>startx ... w00t ;-) </p>

<p>After some customizing I really like Gnome 2.6.0, although it will definitely take me some time to get used to the spacial nautilus (yeah, I know that I can switch it off, but I basically like the idea, although it isn't new at all ;-) )
At least for me the whole Gnome desktop now seems to be more constant in its look&feel compared to 2.4 ... perhaps I will write a small review or something like that.</p><hr /><p>But first I have to emerge it on my workstation ;-)</p></body></html>
