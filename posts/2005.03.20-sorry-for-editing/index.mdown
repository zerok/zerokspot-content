# Sorry for editing

Argh... it's really late here, but I really start to feel like someone who can't write anymore :-? I had to edit the last 2 posts multiple times <em>after</em> publishing them which definitely sucks... not only because they both trackback'd some other sites which now also have the typos permanently stored in their databases ;-) Perhaps I should really stop blogging after 22:00 :-)

Sorry for that :-)
