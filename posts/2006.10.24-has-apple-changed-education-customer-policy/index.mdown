# Has Apple changed education customer policy?

I just went over to Apple's online store to see how much Apple would want from me for one of those new MacBookPros with Core 2 Duos. Right before entering my credentials identifying myself as a student I noticed a [shift in the amount of products](http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/AtInd) you're allowed to use that discount for per year. It seems like only one desktop machine and one notebook is allowed anymore. But at least I could buy up to 2 displays ...

I guess here goes every plan on building a server farm with Mac Minis within a single year ;)
