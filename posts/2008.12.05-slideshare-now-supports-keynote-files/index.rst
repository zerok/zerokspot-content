Slideshare now supports Keynote files
#####################################

Something great for all you Keynote users out there: No longer will you have to convert your slides to PDFs or Powerpoint files whenever you want to upload them to Slideshare; `they finally support your files natively <http://blog.slideshare.net/2008/12/05/you-can-now-upload-keynote-files-to-slideshare/>`_. There is one small catch, though: You will have to zip them since Keynote "files" are bundles which in turn are nothing more than folders on steroids.
