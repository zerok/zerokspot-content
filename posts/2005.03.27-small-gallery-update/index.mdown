# Small gallery update

During the last couple of days I was working on my little gallery script so I'm making quite good progress. I think I will be able to upload it somewhen tonight. The only item from <a href="http://weblog.zerokspot.com/posts/290/">my wishlist</a> that I haven't implemented yet is the RSS/Atom/WhAtEvEr support. Since I've currently quite a lot of work to do for the university and for the job (and I also want to have some time for <cite>Prince of Persia</cite> ;-) ) I doubt that I'll implement this feature this weekend. Perhaps somewhen during the coming week then ;-)
