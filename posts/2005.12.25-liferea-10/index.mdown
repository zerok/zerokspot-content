# Liferea 1.0

I just want to congratulate everyone involved with the development of Liferea for daring to take the big 1.0 step :) I've been using Liferea for the last year more or less exclusively (perhaps with a small sidetrip to Rojo or Bloglines) and it it's really still the only real option for me when it comes to RSS/Atom-reading on Linux.
