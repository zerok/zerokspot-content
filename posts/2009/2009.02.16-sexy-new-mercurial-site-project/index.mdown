# Sexy new Mercurial-site project

<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/snapshots/mercurialscm-20090217-003313.png" class="left postimg" alt="" />Seems like there is finally getting some movement into the whole "get [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/) a new website" project with a [repo](http://bitbucket.org/segv/hg-website/overview/) (incl. forks) being created on bitbucket.org. I don't really know how official that whole thing is but at least [mercurial-scm.org](http://www.mercurial-scm.org/) looks way more sexy than the "classic" MoinMoin-based site. From what it looks like right now, the whole project still seems to be in its early stages content-wise but it's definitely a very important step into the right direction. 

Over the years, even Git got a very flashy intro-page and Mercurial and the community-size/popularity seemed to have stagnated size-wise thanks to the missing "marketing". I really hope that the folks behind this new site will help push Mercurial quite a lot :D
