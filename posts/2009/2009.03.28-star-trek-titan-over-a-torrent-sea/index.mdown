# Star Trek: Titan - Over a Torrent Sea

It's been quite a while since the last book out of the Titan series has been
released and I've been really looking forward to the next installment --
especially after the fairly big role the crew of the Luna-class vessel had
during the resolution of the latest Borg crisis. Now, nearly one and a half
year after [Sword of Damocles][] Titan has finally continued its mission of
exploration with [Christopher L. Bennett][]'s [Over a Torrent Sea][].

-------------------------------

This time, the plot mainly takes place on the water planet Droplet where the
crew -- and ensign [Lavena][] in particular -- get to know an ecosystem
completely different from what they're used to and full of surprises and
possible misunderstandings. The crew gets to know a new and completely alien
civilization, Riker and Lavena go missing and all that right when [Deanna Troi][]
is about to give birth to hers and [Will Riker][]'s child.

Christopher L. Bennett once again managed to create a whole universe full of
life and especially at the end it's close to getting mind-blowing. Every
action has unsuspected consequences for everyone involved. Part of this is
also the constant struggle of the crew how to handle the situation while not
violating the [Prime Directive][]. This is also the focus of a small side-story
around the birth of Troi's child and [Doctor Ree][]. 

Part of the theme of the whole story is also the intimacy of the whole crew,
and at least for me the author went a little bit too far there. At one time
I was starting to wonder if anyone on that ship does anything *besides* having
sex while off-duty. I think I can see why he wanted to show some more intimate
details in this book (given Lavenas role), though. Especially one scene
between Riker and the Aili is a bit too intimate and in my opinion doesn't
really fit in all that well with the rest of the story.

Compared to everything else I've read over the last 2 years this is probably the
most non-violent SciFi-novel. In a side-story one person gets stun-phasered
and this is basically the only time someone is shot at. In general, the whole
book is all about what made Star Trek great for me: exploring and experiencing
new worlds and not shooting at everything in sight and asking questions later.
