# Finally some choice

The wait is finally over! It only took more than two and a half year but since yesterday <a href="http://www.amazon.de/MP3-Musik-Downloads/b/ref=sa_menu_mp31?ie=UTF8&amp;node=77195031">Amazon MP3</a> is now also finally available in Austria :D It naturally still comes with its own little downloader application (which is at least available on Windows, OSX and Linux) but that didn&#39;t prevent me from spending 15 EUR with them right away. Currently they have a huge selection of albums for sale - at a price about half of what Apple wants - so I just couldn&#39;t resist :-)

Now I&#39;m just waiting for either Apple or Amazon to give me access to international tracks :-)
