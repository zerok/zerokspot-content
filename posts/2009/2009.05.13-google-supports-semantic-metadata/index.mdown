# Google announced more support for semantic metadata

After companies like [Yahoo][] and [Technorati][] have no experimented for quite
some time with support for [Microformats][], [Google][] announced their own support
for some Microformat and [RDFa][] vocabularies. According to [James Turner][] of
the O'Reilly Radar this only works for a handful of partner-sites right now
but, I guess, this should only be a matter of time. For now the supported
metadata is about *product reviews*, *product prices* and *personal details*.
Google's made some more details available in their [documentation][].

What's in my opinion really nice about this is, that Google supports not just
one encoding but Microformats *and* RDFa. If you ask 3 people how to handle
metadata on the web, you'll probably get 3 different answers ;-)
