<html><body><h1>Some movement on Google Groups?</h1><p>
	It has been only a week since I <a href="http://zerokspot.com/weblog/2009/10/27/little-love-for-googlegroups/">thought</a> about <a href="http://groups.google.com">Google Groups</a> and imagine my surprise when I noticed this little box on the &quot;Join this group&quot; page:</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<img alt="A select box for your e-mail address on Google Groups" height="207" src="/uploads/ggroups-selectmail.png" width="388" /></p>
<p>
	You can finally also select your Google Domain Apps e-mail addresses when joining a group, which was very high on my all-time most-wanted list for a really long time. It&#39;s not perfect yet (you can&#39;t use your aliases yet) but it&#39;s definitely a nice enough addition on its own :D</p>
