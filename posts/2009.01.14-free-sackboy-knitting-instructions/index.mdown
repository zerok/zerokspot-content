# Free Sackboy-knitting instructions

<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/snapshots/knittingsackboysun-20090114-122809.png" alt="" class="left" />Remember issue 49 if Simply Knitting and its great tutorial on how to make your own Sackboy? Well, me neither. If I was living in the UK I'm quite sure I'd have bought that issue, but since it is not available here I had to keep on living without my own handmade Sackboy. I was looking all over the place for alternatives but, honestly, importing something like that all the way from Hong Kong felt kind of ridiculous to me. 

I never would have guessed that the original instructions were also available for free [on the Sun's website](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/fun/gizmo/article2056598.ece), though ... and ever since new-year's eve 2008 :D
