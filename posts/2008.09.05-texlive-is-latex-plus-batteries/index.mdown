# TeXLive = (La)TeX + Batteries

One of the problems I had to fight for a long time when using TeX over the years was that I often found a snippet on the net that was supposed to do exactly what I've been looking for, but when I then tried to use it at least one .sty or some other kind of package was missing and it was once again Google-time. When I switched to the fruity side of computing MacPorts installed [TeXLive](http://tug.org/texlive/) for me. TeXLive is a TeX distribution by the TUG, the TeX User Groups, that's at least according to the German news-site [heise.de](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/TeX-Distribution-TeX-Live-2008-veroeffentlicht--/meldung/115367) the biggest TeX distribution out there. 

So 2 days ago the [TUG](http://www.tug.org/) released this year's edition of the distribution that comes with tons of new stuff, most notably a package manager (`tlmgr`) that lets you easily add, remove and update TeX packages. People using [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) should know this whole idea of actually managing TeX packages ;-) For a complete listing of additions, checkout the [relevant page in the docs](http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news). 

And perhaps, while working on my master thesis, I can finally dig a little deeper into TeX without having to google for packages every couple of seconds thanks to TeXLive :-)
