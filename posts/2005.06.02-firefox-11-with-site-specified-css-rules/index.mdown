# Firefox 1.1 with site specified CSS rules

Yesterday the Mozilla Foundation released the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/deerpark/releases/alpha1.html">first Alpha of Firefox 1.1</a> which includes quite a lot new features like partial SVG support, some new JavaScript implementations ... and <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2004Aug/0135.html">site specific CSS rules</a> :D

-------------------------------



Since I now have finally found the right collection of Extensions and configured my Firefox like I want it to be I don't really want to replace it with a development release just now, but perhaps I will still try it tomorrow and if it's just for playing around with my userContent.css ;-)
