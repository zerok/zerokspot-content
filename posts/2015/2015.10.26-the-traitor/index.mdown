# The Traitor

This month's reading assignment for Sword & Laser was ["The Traitor"][tt] by
Seth Dickinson of [Destiny][d]-fame. This also marked the first fantasy book
I've read in many many years. It's been so long, I can't even remember which my
last one was. I usually don't enjoy medieval-ish fantasy stories but this one
really surprised me.

While the author indicated that this was but the first in at least a small
set of stories the tale being told here is mostly complete. At least I didn't
feel left on a cliff hanging after the last page.

------------------

The universe that was created here is quite fascinating. The focus is a huge
empire going around the world conquering other cultures and forcing their way of
life on them. Eugenics, imperialism, homophobia, they are all topics here. This
empire (called the Empire of Masks) is explored from the point of view of Baru
Cormorant (her name is also part of the title of the US edition) who gets
assimilated very early in her youth but swears to conquer this huge power in
order to restore the culture she came from from before the Masquerade conquered
it.

Her characterisation is extremely detailed but not only hers. All major
characters (and there are quite many of them) get enough room to be explored
(although one or two could have seen more details). That being said, the author
doesn't shy away from just killing characters when it would make sense instead
of saving them for later books. Same goes for the locations. Once the story
leaves a place you know the story is completed there.

After completing the book this morning I gave it a 5/5 rating on Goodreads right
away. It is not perfect but the story esp. towards the end was just too
thrilling and an emotional roller-coaster ride. The whole universe including the
Empire of the Mask and all other cultured around it feels very much alive. It
hasn't made me a fantasy-fan, but it increased the chances that I'll read the
next book in the series tremendously ðŸ˜‰
