# One year with Emacs

It's now been a bit over a year that I've decided to give [Emacs][] a try after
using VIM and Sublime Text and Textmate before that for the last 10 years or
so. And since even small anniversaries have to be celebrated, here a quick
run-down of things I've learnt:

* 10 year means a lot of muscle memory to get rid of, so after a month I've
  stopped trying and ended up simply integrating the amazing [evil-mode][] into
  my Emacs setup. Best of both worlds!
* I've enjoyed Elisp more than I expected. I even started learning [Clojure][]
  last month which will hopefully re-animate me to get into Elisp again ðŸ˜‰
* Currently, [my Emacs configuration][dotfiles] is stored as one larger
  [OrgMode][] file. As much as I love OrgMode, I'm not convinced anymore, that
  this is the right way for me and my config. Perhaps I just need to write more
  a story around each setting but as it is right now (with little by-text except
  for source-references etc.) it doesn't feel like an improvement over multiple
  .el files with comments.
* Last year I thought that OrgMode would end up being *the* killer feature for
  me, but - as it turns out - [Magit][] is even more amazing for my
  workflow. Previously I was using git nearly exclusively through the
  commandline as no wrapper could actually make it easier to more
  convenient. And then came Magit 2.0. Simply try it!

Well, that's basically it so far. I'm still writing far too little Elisp for my
taste but at least only lazyness is stopping me right now. Whenever I see
something I'd like to have automated in my workflow I open \*scratch\* right
away and start hacking. VIM never got me that far! But I haven't gone beyong
these simple scripts so far.

After 13 months now I'm still enjoying nearly everything about Emacs and for now
am looking forward to many more years of using it! That and I hope I will
finally try to write about new things I learn and find for myself here. It's not
like I haven't tried that before ...
