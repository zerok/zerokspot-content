#EFEFEF; max-width: 300px" alt=""> I loved WriteTheDocs Europe 2015! Roll
credits! ... let's start from the begin, though. [WriteTheDocs][wtd] is a community
around technical writing that also organises meetups and conferences. If you
know the documentation hosting platform [ReadTheDocs][rtd], it's by some of the
same people and both things are to some degree interlinked. Having no
documentation-centric meetup group in my area I was completely excited when I
first learnt about there being a conference scheduled for the first week of
September in Prague. Planning started immediately!

------------------

## The Why

For me, documentation is an implicit part of the job. My actual job-description
says "software developer" but IMHO you can't get around also documenting what
you're doing unless you don't want anyone (including yourself after a week)
being able to use it. For me, personally, that means writing simple READMEs for
my hobby projects before even starting with them to helping with internal and
external documentation at work using tools like Confluence and Sphinx, and tons
of other things in between. It's also something I enjoy a lot as it helps
bringing certain design aspects and potential problems to light in a similar way
that pure software-engineering methods like TDD do.

Getting tips from pros on how they work, and learning techniques to improve my
writing and making the end-result more useful to others would be wonderful!


## The How

So last Sunday I hopped onto a train to Prague and 7 hours later arrived at a
wonderful pre-conference reception event at the new [Apiary][ap] offices just a
few blocks from [my hotel][hotel] (I'm getting really good at this ðŸ˜‰). I knew
absolutely no-one there but after just a few rounds, grabbing a beer and some
food, I got into a few discussions about Confluence and Sphinx. The atmosphere
was extremely welcoming and not a single eyebrow was raised at me not being a
technical writer ðŸ˜Š.

Sadly, the long travel time in an A/C'd train sitting at the sun-sided window
had taken its toll and so I had to excuse myself rather early in the hope to be
fit for the actual conference the next morning.

The main event took place at the [Klub LÃ¡vka][kl] right below the beautiful
Charles Bridge at the east bank of the Vitava river. Funny thing is that I've
seen that restaurant many years ago during my first trip to Prague with my
parents and wanted to go there. Well, now I got the chance to do that for two
whole days ðŸ˜Š


## My Takeaways

Usually, I'd now write about a couple of my favourite talks but picking
favourites here would be futile and this whole post would be doomed to
explode. I simply learnt so much, I guess I will just write a simple takeaway
section. So, here we go:

* **Glossaries** can help solve a lot of issues when it comes to communicating
  between developers, QA, support and the client. (Emilie Boillat's talk
  [Whatchamacallit: Controlled Vocabularies for Technical Writers][eb])

* It's not just me who tries to make text **more emotional** by using
  emojis. (Sonja Heinen's talk [Visual Documentation Language][sh])

* There is so much more you can automatically check within your documentation
  than just spelling. (Adam Dangoor's talk
  [Tested and Correct, How to Make Sure Your Documentation Keeps Working][ad])

* I should definitely use thesauri more often. (Emilie Boillat's talk
  [Whatchamacallit: Controlled Vocabularies for Technical Writers][eb])

* Focus more on guidelines than rules to not prevent people from adapting a
  template in order to describe something in the best way possible. (
  [Free Your Mind and Your Docs Will Follow][pk] by Patrick Keegan)

* Provide clear and easy to find pathways through your documentation. (
  [Gardening Open Docs][fs] by Florian Scholz & Jean-Yves Perrier)

* The distinction between "micro-copy" and "embedded
  help". ([Before the docs: writing for user interfaces][ba] by Beth Aitman)

* Interview users to build up the vocabulary of your documentation and UI
  elements. ([Before the docs: writing for user interfaces][ba] by Beth Aitman)

* I don't want to publish any academic papers ðŸ˜‰
  ([The quest for scientific credit for software documentation][aj] by Anna
  Jaruga)

* Docs should be information or teaching tools, not persuading. (from
  [All roads might not lead to docs][ce] by Christina Elmore)

I could go on but this post is already long enough and there is still so much
more to tell ðŸ˜Š


## Feedback for the Organisers

The organisers also explicitly asked for feedback as this is still a very young
conference series and there is always things that could be improved or not
praised enough!

* The food in general was great but at the pre-conference reception it was
  simply amazing. Just ordering some takeout food is absolutely fine if it has
  this level of quality. I wish there were services like this in Graz!

* Big thanks for the fresh fruits during every break. So many events don't have
  any and here it was nearly too much ðŸ˜Š

* 30 minutes per talk is just the right length. 10 minute breaks for speaker
  switches are perhaps a bit too long, though. For a single-track conference 5
  minutes would IMHO suffice.

* The chairs were a bit too close together so taking notes with pen and paper
  was a bit hard.

* Oh that projector ðŸ˜©

A huge thank you to all the organisers, supporters, and sponsors!


## Concluding ...

That's about it. WriteTheDocs Europe 2015 was simply an amazing event with
awesome people and great talks. I hope that next year's US event will be around
the time when PyCon happens so I might be able to combine these two events!

Can't wait to meet all these fine folks again!
