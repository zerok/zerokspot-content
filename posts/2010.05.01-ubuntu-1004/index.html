<h1>Ubuntu 10.04 on my Netbook</h1>
<p>Back when I got my very own netbook, the first thing I did was installing
Ubuntu 9.10 NBR on it. The experience was phenomenal: Just about everything
worked out of the box with a few minor exceptions. So I saw nothing really
stopping me from upgrading to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/1004features">10.04</a> when it 
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-edition">finally arrived last Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>Well, nothing except for the Austrian mirror hopelessly hammered by 
requests and therefor unusably slow. Since I had to get up at 0500 in the
morning on Friday, I had to skip the update and hope for some more
speed on Friday afternoon. Well, not so much. In the end I just went
with the main server and managed to update the system. It took a couple
of hours but there was virtually no user interaction required (which 
really helps when you try to play MW2 at the same time ;-))</p>

<p>Previously there were a couple of minor issues like brightness controls,
but this was a really simple fix after I found <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/512567">this issue</a> on the 
tracker which contains a workaround.</p>
<p>And this morning I even managed to finally get tethering with my iPhone
working -- which is actually quite well documented but I think I just
always forgot to do the DHCP request and therefor never could go online.
In general the iPhone support is really nice so far. Once plugged in
the system asks if it should import the photos from it and if 
Rhythmnbox should be used to access the songs on it. I think there is
no real synchronzing just yet, but it is definitely a huge step 
forward :-D</p>
<p>I don't have to mention the new default theme, do I? It is
just gorgeous.</p>
<p>Naturally, some small problems are there, though: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The battery icon, even when fully charged, indicates some charging
    as can be seen in the screenshot.
    <img src="charger.png" class="right" alt="" /></p>
</li>

<p>At first Rhythmbox completely refused to let me log into my 
    Last.fm account. There are quite a <a href="http://www.lastfm.de/group/Rhythmbox/forum/8096/_/586760">few topics</a> about this already
    and after some trying I managed to get it working, too, but
    it was still quite annoying.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, though, I'm extremely satisfied with this release. I'm
even thinking about leaving my MacBook at home for the next 
conference ... although I might still have it at least with me for
the respective sprints :-/</p>
<p>I don't know yet, what I should think about Canonical using the Ubuntu
brand for their "Ubuntu One" and "Ubuntu One Music Store" services,
though, since they have not all that much to do with open source, 
Ubuntu's core value in my eyes.</p>
