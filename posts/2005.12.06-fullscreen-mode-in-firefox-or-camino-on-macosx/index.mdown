# Fullscreen mode in Firefox or Camino on MacOSX?

Am I blind or does neither of these Gecko browsers support a fullscreen mode? IMO really strange and quite disappointing esp. since the Linux version (and probably also the Windows version) of Firefox has this feature. And that it's possible also shows Opera... Really stupid since I thought about making some presentation in S5 but something like that doesn't look all that great in a maximized window :(

So, let me make a small feature request to the developers of Firefox and Camino: Fullscreen mode please :)
