# Daily -> Weekly linkdumps

Just in case you're missing the daily link dumps: I've stopped them and will replace these dumps with weekly editions of the spurl dumps. Somehow the amount of link dumps got larger than the number of "normal" posts lately which doesn't look all that good IMO ;-) True: Weekly dumps will include quite a big number of links but at least they will be in one single post and not fill the startpage if I don't post something for a few days.
