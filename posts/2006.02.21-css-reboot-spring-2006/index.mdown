# CSS Reboot Spring 2006

Well, another half-year, another [CSS Reboot](http://www.cssreboot.com/) competition ;) But honestly, I really like the current theme of zerokspot.com and don't want to really drop everything (like I did right after the last Reboot took place \*g\*) but instead I want to evolve the theme a little bit. There are currently two things I'd really love to try: A 3-col and a 1-col design ... yupp, I have to chooce one ... or leave it just as it is today. My main motivation for the 3-col variant would be the extra space I could use for buttons, a mini-version of the blogroll, ma.gnolia links etc. While the the advantage of the 1-col design is definitely its focus on the content.

I think I will just start hacking around a little bit and see what comes out ;)
