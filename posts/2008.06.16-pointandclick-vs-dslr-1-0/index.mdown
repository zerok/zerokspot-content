# Point'n click vs. DSLR - 1:0

I love my D50, I really do. But recently I often thought about still getting once again a small and cheap point and click camera (perhaps the now cheap-as-dirt Panasonic Lumix TZ3) because I could always carry it around with me; at work, on my way to work, back home from work ... you get the picture.

"Priorities", people! Photo ... life ... photo ... life ... photo! That said, this is definitely one of the coolest pictures I've seen of a tornado to date.

I don't intend to take photos in life-threatening situations but instead set a quite high nice-level on saving my hide. Still, for other situations a small point and click would definitely come in handy. Does anyone of you perhaps have any recommendations? So far I'm quite in favor of the above mentioned TZ3 since my father has the same and is quite happy with it so far (nearly a year old by now). On the other hand, I'd like to give Canon a try, but don't want to spend more than 250EUR. Any ideas?
