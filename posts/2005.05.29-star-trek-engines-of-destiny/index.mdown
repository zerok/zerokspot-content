# Star Trek: Engines of Destiny

<a class="left" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zerok/16203226/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos14.flickr.com/16203226_977b84485e_t.jpg" width="81" height="100" alt="Engines of Destiny" /></a> This book is about what happened to Capt. Scott after being rescued from the crashed Jenolen. The story that is told here involves nearly everything every Star Trek TNG fan should like: Borg, time travelling, alternate universes and so on. This book is more or less <cite>Generations</cite> before the 7th movie but it also has quite a lot to do with another Star Trek movie ... enough! This is everything I can tell you without having to put a large spoiler warning on this post ;-)

While I really liked the story of this book and esp. the parts that are about Guinan, I wasn't all that happy with the writing style as a whole. There were simply too many paragraphs that only described the battle in the characters' minds. Not that I don't like knowing the motivation behind people's actions but too much is too much ;-)
