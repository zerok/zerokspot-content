# Flip4Mac WMV

Just found [this](http://coolosxapps.net/2006/01/11/windows-media-components-for-quicktime/) :D ... and after rebooting my Powerbook it even works. Really great since watching Gamespot streams using the Windows media player really sucks. If you have the browser window not focused the WMP seems to drop frames or something like that which is kind of annoying if you're just writing something in another window and want to watch a video in the window next to it ;) I don't know if this also applies to the standalone player but think so.

Anyway, thanks [Flip4Mac](http://www.flip4mac.com/) for this great and FREE component ... which even comes with an uninstaller ;)
