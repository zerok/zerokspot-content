# What's in my cache?

While playing a little bit around with JavaScript I noticed something quite funny: If you want to know, what your browser has cached (at least what Opera8 or Firefox have cached ;-) ) simply enter "opera:cache" for Opera8 or "about:cache" in your browser's address bar.

-------------------------------



While Opera just gives a simple listing including the key, size and address of the cached object, Firefox is definitly more verbose and lets you choose which cache you want to browse: Memory or Disk Cache. You also learn when the cached object expires and was last modified :-)
