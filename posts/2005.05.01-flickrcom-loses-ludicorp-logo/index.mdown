# Flickr.com loses Ludicorp logo

Just a small thing I've noticed this morning, but the <a href="http://ludicorp.com/">Ludicorp</a> logo on <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr.com</a> is now gone and ways replace with the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> logo :-( I just hope that this is the only thing that changes on Flickr. Not that I'm a Yahoo-hater, but I signed up on Flickr because I wanted Flickr and nothing else. Let's hope that this was the only change...
