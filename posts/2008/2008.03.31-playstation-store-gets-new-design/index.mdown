# PLAYSTATION Store gets new design

Sweet, Sony announced today, that a total redesign of the PSN Store interface will see the light of your PS3 this April (at least if you are in Europe) as reported earlier today by [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/374029/psn-redesign-revealed).

And the store definitely needs it. I'm not really a big fan of the Xbox Live Marketplace either, but the current PLAYSTATION Store layout is just downright bad. For instance, if you access the "Games" category, you get a listing of sub-categories ... in chunks of 5 or so. The selection of a game when you've finally found your category is similarly complicated. Let's just hope, that the new design will make everything better.

Although I still don't understand, how a rollout can take 2 weeks ...
