# PULSE ... the browser-only show for PSN

Last summer they launched the Qore magazine for paying subscribers and on the 5th a [new show](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/12/05/introducing-pulse-presented-by-playstation-network/) on [PSN](http://www.us.playstation.com/PSN) called "PULSE". It's basically a small preview of what's about to get released in the near future combined with some nice charts, so actually not bad for a corporate advertisement show.

There are some bummers for me, though, as far as I can tell: Not downloadable (just in the browser, I think), no RSS/Atom-feed and not on iTunes. The last one is kind of redundant but the first two really annoy me. I simply don't really enjoy watching shows in a browser but on my iPod on the go or in Quicktime/VLC when on the laptop. So eventually it will probably go the way of Gametrailers for me: Every now and then, but probably not regularly (GT has at least downloadable views but only the smallest versions in the feed).
