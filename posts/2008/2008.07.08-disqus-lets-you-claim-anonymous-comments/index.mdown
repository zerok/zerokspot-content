# Disqus lets you claim anonymous comments

Ever made a comment on a weblog that was using [Disqus](http://disqus.com) while you were not? Well, now you can claim such comments according to [this post](http://blog.disqus.net/2008/07/07/claiming-your-unverified-profile-and-comments/) on the [Disqus blog](http://blog.disqus.net/) so that you don't lose track of them if you afterwards created your own account on Disqus.

The process itself is pretty straight forward. When you see a comment that you made without being logged in, you click on your avatar and get redirected to a profile page. Such a page is generated for every anonymous commenter's email-address. You can now lay a claim on this page by entering the email address that it belongs to. Then you receive an email to confirm that this email address really belongs to you; and that's it.

Since this profile is email based (the user-specific part of the profile's URL is basically the MD5-hash of the email address) I guess this now includes all your comments made with this email address into your [Disqus](http://disqus.com) profile.

Really nice. Is this perhaps the first step for real comment importer? ;-)
