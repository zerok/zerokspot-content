# The End of Jaiku?

ars technica today had an [article](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080108-jaiku-users-flee-to-twitter-as-a-result-of-googles-neglect.html) about a whole lot of people leaving
the locked down [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com/) and moving over to Twitter because of the instability of
the service and missing contact with the developers. It's just funny because
[Michael](http://twitter.com/crashproof) and I were just talking about 
what happened to Jaiku right before I read this article :-)

Right when I first heard about Jaiku, I really liked it esp.
because of the whole channel idea which simply made it more than just a 
Twitter-clone, but after Google bought them and made
the whole service invite-only, nothing really happened there anymore, as
far as I can tell. No new post on the [blog](http://www.jaiku.com/blog/), not
a single message on the [jaiku-feed](http://jaiku.jaiku.com/). It's really sad :-(
I guess sometimes now being bought by Google is *a good thing*.

**Update:** Seems like the folks over at Jaiku are [still allive](http://www.jaiku.com/blog/2008/01/10/weve-joined-google-now-what/) :-)
