# BlogTalk 2006: Day 1 (pt.2) - Starcraft

Nothing big to write about for the rest of the day:

-------------------------------



* Playing Starcraft nearly all day

* Eating Ramen for the first time in my life... good soup ;-)

* Continueing playing Starcraft until 4am



I guess that sums it up pretty well.
