# Gazerk: A search engine for game(r)s?

Yet another search engine just saw the light of the web for the first time: [Gazerk](http://gazerk.com); a search engine for gamers. Found it on [Kotaku](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/1up/gamer-search-engine-176203.php), tried it, and [was quite disappointed](http://gazerk.com/search.jsp?q=wii&t=vgames.any). 

-------------------------------



Ok, perhaps I've just missed the point here, but a search engine for game(r)s should perhaps give me the Nintedo homepage for the Wii as the first result item when I search for the word "wii" ;) Actually, non of the hits on the first results page had _anything_ to do with the new Nintendo console, nor had the "Games" or "Reviews" categories anything useful to offer, although at least in the "Reviews" section was ... a game. Not a Wii game, but at least a game ;)



Thanks for the try ZiffDavis, but I will stick with [my Video Games search on Rollyo](http://rollyo.com/search.html?q=wii&sid=1640&x=0&y=0).
