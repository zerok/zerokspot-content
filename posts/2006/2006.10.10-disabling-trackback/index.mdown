# Disabling Trackback

<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/trackback_spam.png" alt="" class="left"/> Just a small note: I've just disable trackback for now (and probably for some time) because I'm simply not motivated to moderate the about 200 spam posts I get every single day. As a replacement I will add hopefully sometime this week a small section where all the links pointing to a post or the whole site will be listed (based on search results on Technorati and probably also google and yahoo).

Good bye trackback, and thank you for the spam ;)
