# SearchFoxRSS closing down

If you're one of the people who got an invitation to the <a href="http://rss.searchfox.com/">SearchFox RSS</a> aggregator you should have gotten a mail this morning where Esteban Kozak informs that the service will be shut down on January 25. 

-------------------------------



While I have never really used this service except for trying to determine if it's superior to Bloglines or not, it's sad to see another competitor on the online RSS aggregator market disappearing. Not that there is no competition left though. Let's just hope that there will be at least a few of these services that are able to get out of BETA.
