# CoComment integrated

<img src="http://zerokspot.com/uploads/coco-btn-125x50-manage.gif" class="left" alt=""/> I've integrated [CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com) into the comments part of post template, so if you have a CoComment account you should no longer have to enable CoComment manually when you post a comment here. If you notice any problems, please let me know. I'm completely new to CoCo (CC was already taken in my vocabulary ;)) so I might have missed something :)
