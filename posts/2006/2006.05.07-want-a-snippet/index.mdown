# Want a snippet?

Today I found [parsed.org](http://www.parsed.org) via a post on Jason Tucker's weblog [everythingtech.tv](http://www.everythingtech.tv/2006/05/06/parsedorg/) were he interviews its founder. Parsed.org is a community site for programmers offering small code snippets for common problems like for example how to [access the raw POST data in PHP](http://parsed.org/tip/166/).

I knew I had seen something like this before so I started googling a little bit around. And I was right: [http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/](http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/) is basically the same but it seems with far more users or it's just around a bit longer.



Thanks Jason for two new bookmarks ;)
