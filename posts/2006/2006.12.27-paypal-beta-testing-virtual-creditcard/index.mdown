# PayPal beta-testing virtual CreditCard

According to [CNET](http://news.com.com/2061-10791_3-6146082.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-20&subj=news) this virtual CC should be compatible with every website that supports Mastercard. Sounds actually like a pretty neat idea, esp. since there seems to be no additional fee.

Nice idea PayPal :)
