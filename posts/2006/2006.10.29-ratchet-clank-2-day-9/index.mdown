# Ratchet & Clank 2 - Day 9

Done :D Finishing the game wasn't really hard after upgrading the shield and the Heavy Bouncer. I guess it took about 3 minutes to finish the final boss. After surviving the outro I got the choice between moving back in time before I bet the boss or restarting the game in a challenge mode where all my weapons are still there and every bolt I get is multi-folded. Well ;-) I guess I will still spend some time in the challenge mode to upgrade every weapon and then move along to R&amp;C3 :D
