# Disney to offer TV-show-downloads?

According to [netzzeitung.de](http://www.netzeitung.de/internet/391652.html) Disney is about to make TV-shows snown on ABC available for free the day after they have been broadcasted. The whole archive will be ad-financed which I have absolutely no problem with :)

But the interesting part will be if they really allow download or just streaming and what technology they're going to use. I don't even dare to ask, if they could do it without going the dark'n dirty DRM-path. But since they want to prevent viewers from skipping the ads I guess the methods are clear: "streaming" (or bettere just embedding into their own player) and DRM to prevent the ad-skipping :-( But if the quality is good and also people from outside the USA could watch it on any platform, it could still become a huge success :)
