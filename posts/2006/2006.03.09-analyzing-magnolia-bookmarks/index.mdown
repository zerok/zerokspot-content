# Analyzing Ma.gnolia bookmarks

Just to let you know, why I'm currently posting so little: I'm still playing "Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time" as if there was nothing else out there to do and I also got "Street Fighter Alpha3 MAX" for the PSP today. So there's not much time to do anything else ;)

-------------------------------



On the other side, I've been working on a script for analyzing my usage of the [Ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com) service. The first results can be seen [here](http://www.zerokspot.com/ma.ana/). For now the script fetches all the bookmarks from ma.gnolia and builds for every month a small site with a tag cloud and a histogram which includes all the links. Not much, but I'm currently thinking about other statistics. If you have any suggestions, why should also be included in such a script, please let me know :)
