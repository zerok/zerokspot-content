# Ma.gnolia integrates groups in bookmarklet

The new social bookmarking service [Ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com) has enhanced their primary bookmarklet with a new field. Now you can finally add a bookmark right away to one of the groups you're a member of without having to save the bookmark first to your own collection and then copying it over to the group. With this new addition Ma.gnolia could get even more interesting for people who want to use a social bookmarking service but also want to be able to cooperate with a specific group of people to build a bookmark collection.
