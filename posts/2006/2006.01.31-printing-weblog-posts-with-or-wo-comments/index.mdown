# Printing weblog posts with or w/o comments?

I'm currently working on a new blog to get this weblog here a little bit more focused on tech related stuff and ran into a small dilemma. When printing a blog post I'm normally just interested in the post itself and not in the comments made by other users. But I also can remember situations, where the interesting content was within the comments to that post and not within the post itself.

So my question now is: Would you prefer the hardcopy to also include the comments or would you prefer it to only include the actual post?
