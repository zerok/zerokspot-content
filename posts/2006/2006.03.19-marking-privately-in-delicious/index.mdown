# Marking privately in del.icio.us

Joshua Schachter has [just announced](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/03/private_saving_.html) a "private bookmarking" feature for [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), which is currently marked as experimental. After enabling it in your settings window (search right sidebar for the "private saving" item under "experimental") you get a new checkbox with the bookmarklet (and any bookmark posting for) with the label "do not share". In your bookmark repository such bookmarks will then get an addition red mark saying "not shared". Not much to say about it except that it seems to work ;)
