# All your e-learning systems belong to Blackboard

... at least in the US. Seems like there is yet another great US-patent around, granting the Washington based company [Blackboard](http://blackboard.com) basically exclusivity on e-learning platforms. [Michael Feldstein] has a nice quote from that patent which seems to be written general enough to threaten applications like Moodle, Claroline or "Your School/University's e-learning platform".

But since the patent was filed in [June 2000](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,988,138.PN.&OS=PN/6,988,138&RS=PN/6,988,138) I don't think this will hold that long thanks to some probably existing Prior Art claims as [Seb Schmoller](http://fm.schmoller.net/2006/07/blackboards_us_.html) mentioned on his blog. He also mentioned, that the patent seems to be pending in the EU ... good luck with that ;)
