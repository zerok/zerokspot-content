# phpMyAdmin, frames and Safari

Just a note to people like myself who like multiple browsers and are looking for the slightest reason to jump to the other browser again: If you're using phpMyAdmin (one of the newer versions) and are annoyed by Safari seemingly not being able to open links from the sidebar in the main frame but instead opening a whole new window: Get a [nightly WebKit built](http://nightly.webkit.org/) ;)

-------------------------------



Since this is the first time for me using one of the WebKit nightlies I can only say as much as that it seems like someone of the devs has fixed this really annoying problem. Thank you for that. :D
