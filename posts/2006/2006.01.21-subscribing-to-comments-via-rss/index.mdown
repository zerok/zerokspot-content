# Subscribing to Comments via RSS

<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/feed-icon/default/images/jpg-white/feed-icon-32x32.jpg" class="left"/> Just for those out there who don't know this feature of WordPress yet: You can subscribe to the comments posted to a specific post by simply appending ?feed=rss or &feed=rss to the URL of the post. For the lazy people out there like myself I've now added a small feed icon to the comments section (if there's already a comment on it) of every post so that you can easily subscribe to them.
