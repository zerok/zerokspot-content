# Ma.gnolia out of private beta?

Seems like [Ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com) has now left the private beta stage meaning that now finally everyone can get an account ;) I just hope that their servers will survive more users and that I'll find some time today to rewrite my little del.icio.us script that produces the listing in the lower left corner on the mainpage here, to fetch the bookmarks from ma.gnolia now that I use it more often than del.icio.us ;)
