# First Star Trek books of the new year

Today I got my first Star Trek books for the new year: First the new Star Trek:Titan book "Orion's hounds" and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine "The Lives of Dax". I can barely wait to start reading each of them - I haven't yet decided though which will be the first - but first I want to play a little bit around with Drupal ... partially to get me away from Amazon.com to not order more books ;)
