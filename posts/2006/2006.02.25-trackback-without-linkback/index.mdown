# TrackBack without ... LinkBack

Don't get me wrong: I like getting trackback'd. It's a truely Web2.0 way of commenting one someone's article. But I have one small rule for trackbacks here: If the article, doesn't link back to my site, I simply won't put it out of the moderation queue. Why? Because the trackback will actually give the linker a "point" by Google and Technorati (if there is no rel="nofollow") without doing the same for my side of the equation. So please: If you trackback one of my posts, please also link back to that article :)
