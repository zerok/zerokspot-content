# Dreamhost with some hickups this morning?

Seems like Dreamhost has currently some problems with their DNS setup which they also confirmed on their [status page](http://status.dreamhost.com/). So if you've written me a mail somewhen this morning, on my zerokspot.com addresses, please try again (or try horst.gutmann[at]gmail.com) if you haven't heard back from me yet :)
