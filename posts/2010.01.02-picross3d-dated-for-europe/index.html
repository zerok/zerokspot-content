<html><body><h1>Picross 3D dated for Europe</h1><p>
	It seems like <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/picross-3d/61-23984/">Picross 3D</a> for the Nintendo DS finally got a release date for Europe. According to Cubed3 the game will land on February 5th. It&#39;s basically the same idea as with any other picross game, but this time you&#39;re more or less working on a cube and removing parts of it to reveal an object. &nbsp;... And it will feature weekly downloads for even more picross madness :D</p>
<p>
	I so need another puzzle game ;-)</p>
