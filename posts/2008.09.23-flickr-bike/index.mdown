# Flickr on a bike

<img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080923-jmqyptqrsgkg2nppc3xfc9x63d.png" class="left" alt="" />You know the streetview-car, but do you already know the Flickrbike? Take a bike, bundle it with a GPS device, and a camera that takes a picture every 60 seconds and automatically geotags them and you can track the life of your bike, and where you've all been with it. Flickr now [sent such a bike out to various cities](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/09/23/adventures-in-flickr-biking/) in the USA, Europe, Asia and Oceania and you can follow them on Yahoo's new [Start Wearing Purple](http://startwearingpurple.com/purplepedals)-site.

Purple isn't exactly my color, but I'd definitely love to get my hands on such a bike ... as long as I don't have to pay the bandwidth bill for the automatic uploading ;-)
