# Google X

The Google-Labs seem to be currently testing a <a href="http://labs.google.com/googlex/">new look for the startpage of Google</a> which replaces the textlinks with images. While I think it's great that they want to change the look of the startpage and make the other services better accessible, replacing textlinks with images is IMO not really the best way to go. I'd personally prefer it if they simply make the site prettier by using CSS (or perhaps let the visitors use their own stylesheets if they want) as well as dumping the JavaScript and HTML4-elements in favour of xHTML. But Google seems to think, that JavaScript and HTML4 are the only technologies available ;-)
