# Nokia 770

Nokia today announced the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,74866,00.html">Nokia 770 internet tablet</a> which could be described as a bigger PDA without the PIM stuff (except e-mail) but with extended webbrowsing functionality. The nice little thing uses a Linux-based operating system and is planned to be released somewhen in the 3rd quarter of this year. Also the pricing is IMO quite okay with around 400EUR (according to <a href="http://www.golem.de/0505/38248.html">Golem.de</a>). The only feature that I'm really missing is PIM. Sorry, but for mobile internet access I'd normally prefer a sub-notebook. Sure, the price difference here is really huge but still... a handheld without PIM? Not really what I'm looking for.

-------------------------------



But here comes the positive side: Since it's Linux-based I'm quite sure that Nokia will have nothing against people putting their own applications on this handheld so perhaps they will publish some SDKs :-) ... Or to be precise: They already did that :-) The <a href="http://www.maemo.org/">maemo</a> project basically is the development plattform for the Nokia 770. On the projects homepage you already get quite a huge amount of tutorials, API references and also libraries/SDKs. There are already some 3rd party applications available <a href="http://www.indt.org.br/maemo">here</a>. Now I'm just waiting for a decent PIM solution and this could be a real killer-device :D



... not to forget the missing OGG support but I think this is just a matter of time :-)
