I was actually enjoying that much that I ordered the 2nd part when I was only half way through this one.



-------------------------------

The story is always thrilling and IIRC never gets illogical. The more or less exclusive star of this book is Trip while Hoshi is somehow lost in the plot which is in my opinion a little bit disappointing, but only a little since this is basically a book about Trip and how he deals with his past.
