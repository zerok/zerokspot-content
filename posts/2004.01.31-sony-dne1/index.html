<html><body><h1>Sony D-NE 1</h1><p>As the title already indicates I haven't baught Panasonic's CDDA/MP3-Portable but one by Sony. I won't go into much detail here because I really like Panasonic, but a little bit more and faster support for european customers would be really nice ;-)</p>
<p>
<p>But now to the D-NE1:
Really a nice player. It comes with a docking station , 2 rechargeable batteries, a remote control with display, a small bag and earphones. On some webpages I saw pictures of it with some really old- and cheap-looking headphones but Sony seems to have read some product reviews and/or customer feedback and replaced them (I haven't tested them not yet though as I already have Sony earphones with bass-booster ;-) )</p><hr /><p>It also comes with a burning software to create AtracCDs, something that I'm not really interested in, so I probably won't ever use it. All I need is a portable CDDA/MP3-player, and not one for CDDA, MP3 and Atrac :-P</p>
<p>According to Sony the playtime with the rechargables is great, which is something I have to find out in the next weeks :-) </p>
<p>The sound is really nice and clean and the load times between every song aren't that long. After inserting a new CD (mp3) you have to wait for at least 20sec. tough, as the player seems to scan all tracks.</p></p></body></html>
