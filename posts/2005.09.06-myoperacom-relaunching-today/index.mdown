# my.opera.com relaunching today

Opera is about to launch a new version of their community portal <a href="http://my.opera.com">my.opera.com</a>. After the redesign of the main site a few month ago I was really wondering when this would happen :) Also the screenshot that was leaked on <a href="http://operawatch.blogspot.com/2005/09/opera-to-release-new-community-site.html">operawatch</a> really looks promising.
