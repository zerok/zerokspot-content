# Menu editor for Gnome 2.10

<img src="http://www.zerokspot.com/gallery/image.php?id=57&action=viewthumb" class="left" alt=""/>A while back I was considering writing a small menu editor for Gnome 2.10 (or 2.9.x back then) just to get to know some of the Freedesktop standards. Yesterday I found a menu editor that already seems to work :-)

It only does the basics so far but already looks quite promising :-) It's written in Python using PyGTK and PyXDG which makes it easily extensible for me. Since version 0.4.3 doesn't show a preview in the filechooser dialog when selecting an icon for an entry I also took the chance to play once again a little bit around with PyGTK. The result is available <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=122651&postcount=59">here</a>.

And once again: Congratulations and thanks to <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=11397">Amaranth</a> for the work he (?) put into this menu editor :-)
